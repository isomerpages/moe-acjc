## <center> Scholar Development Programme </center>

The College aims to help students achieve their full potential. High-performing students are identified early and admitted to the programme. They are assigned teacher mentors to further develop their potential for scholarships and admissions to top universities both locally and around the world.

Specialised seminars and workshops in interview skills, portfolio building skills and university admission essay writing have been developed specially to provide our scholars with a competitive edge.
