The College aims to help students achieve their full potential. High-performing students are identified after JC1 and admitted to the programme in JC2.  
  
Students will gain invaluable soft skills through sharing sessions by distinguished alumni, workshops on interview and portfolio building skills, and more.  
  
The Scholar Development Programme strives to sharpen students competitive edge for scholarships and admissions to top universities both locally and around the world.
