Started in 1997, ACJCs Music Elective Programme (MEP) aims to develop students’ musical creativity and critical thinking skills. During the course of study, students have the opportunity to discuss music-related issues and analyse music, as well as engage in creative musical collaborations such as group improvisation and instrumental ensemble

Students will be able to:

* Hone and express personal musical interests and strengths
* Develop critical thinking skills
* Conduct independent exploration in areas of interest
* Appreciate Singapore’s cultural heritage and traditions
* Develop as leaders in the music scene and as advocates for the Arts

**Enrichment**<br>
Beyond classroom learning, students are exposed to a wide range of enrichment activities, including lectures, masterclasses and workshops with local and international professors and practitioners. The programme offers many platforms for musical expression, ranging from regular in-house recitals to public performances. Outstanding students in the field of performance have opportunities to be featured as a concerto-soloist, while aspiring young composers may have their original works premiered at our concerts.

One unique ACJC MEP-xperience is our annual recital&nbsp;_@artikulation_, where present and past students of the programme come together to present an evening of solo and chamber music. Through this musical interaction, students are able to relate with and gain valuable musical insights from their peers and seniors.

**Music Elective Scholarship**<br>
In the ACJC MEP, we firmly believe in encouraging and motivating our students in their pursuit of excellence in the field of music. MEP students who have shown great potential and achievement in the different domains of the studies are eligible for the Music Elective Scholarship (MES), offered by the Ministry of Education. They will also be part of the scholarship programme in ACJC, where they have the opportunity to engage with other scholars in various activities and trainings.

More information about the MES can be found online at&nbsp;[MOE's website](https://www.moe.gov.sg/financial-matters/awards-scholarships/programme-scholarships-pre-u).
