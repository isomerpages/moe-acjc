### H2 CHINA STUDIES IN ENGLISH (SYLLABUS 9628)

##### Aims
The China Studies in English (CSE) curriculum focuses on studying developments in
contemporary China from circa 2000 to the present day through an examination of its
economy, politics, society and international relations. The curriculum aims to equip
students with relevant knowledge on contemporary developments in China, develop
their critical thinking and information literacy to understand these developments, and
instil in them an awareness of the regional and global implications of China’s rise. It
also seeks to develop China-conversant citizens who can appreciate Singapore’s
interests and perspectives in its engagement with China, contribute in their own
capacity to further Singapore-China interactions and harness the dynamic
opportunities that China can offer. 
The thinking and information skills that students will acquire over the course of this
subject enable students to be more keenly aware of global trends and appreciate the
significance of current events. We believe that this will better equip students for their
future course of study at the tertiary level.
##### Approach
Our programme is designed to develop students in the following key areas:

1\. Content mastery and up-to-date understanding of the issues in contemporary China through lectures, discussions and research of current events and issues.
Through these discussions, students can be knowledgeable of the developments in
China and sensitive to China’s context; construct their own understanding and
opinions of the issues and share their views; and possess an awareness of regional and
global issues and trends through the study of China’s role as a regional and global
actor.

2. Teaching of Essay and Case Studies skills through critical analysis and writing
workshops. Students will be guided to be information-literate, who can access,
analyse, evaluate and use different types of information critically and effectively.
Approaches to Essay and Case Studies will also equip students with the necessary
skills to answer questions effectively, present clear and logical arguments; and make
well-considered recommendations to address issues related to contemporary China.

3. Interactive seminars where students will engage in presentations on question
approaches and possible arguments. This will allow students to make sense of their
own learning and refine their understanding as they explain and defend their stand.
Researching for presentations will encourage students to take greater ownership of
their learning in line with university expectations.
