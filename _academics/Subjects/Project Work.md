### H1 PROJECT WORK (SYLLABUS 8882)

  

#### Aims

  

In today’s dynamic and fast-changing world, students need to learn how to engage with real-world issues, and process cross-disciplinary and open-ended information presented in a less structured manner. Furthermore, due to the ever-changing nature of the workplace, students need to learn to work together on tasks that require a repertoire of skills and to apply what they have learned to complete a group project. It is on this basis that Project Work (PW) was developed and implemented as a compulsory subject and requirement for local university admission.

Besides enabling students to acquire 21st century competencies like collaboration, communication and information skills, PW is a learning experience for students to synthesise knowledge from various areas of learning, and critically and creatively apply it to real life situations. The learning outcomes for PW include not only the knowledge and skills, but the values and dispositions that underpin the students' acquisition of life skills.

**KNOWLEDGE AND SKILLS**

*   Demonstrate critical and inventive thinking skills in gathering, analysing and evaluating information, and generating ideas that address real-world needs;
*   Communicate clearly, coherently and persuasively in collaborative discussion and in presenting ideas to a specific audience in both written and oral forms;
*    Apply collaborative skills in managing the project effectively to achieve the group’s goals.

  

**VALUES**

*   Respect through appreciating the diverse views and perspectives of team members and others involved in the project;
*   Responsibility through seeking out accurate, credible and current information in order to make informed decisions at different stages of the project;
*   Resilience through persevering in the pursuit of knowledge and understanding, as well as personal growth in the course of navigating the dynamic and uncertain challenges in their research and decision-making;
*   Integrity through representing with fidelity the views and data gathered, as well as adhering to ethical principles in the conduct of research;
*   Care through developing empathy for others and the desire to make a positive difference;
*   Resilience through persevering in the pursuit of knowledge and understanding, as well as personal growth in the course of navigating the dynamic and uncertain challenges in their research and decision-making;
*   Harmony through contributing to a safe learning environment for the discussion of ideas and appreciating the need for both unity and diversity in their team.

**DISPOSITIONS**

*   An intrinsic motivation to wonder and seek new understanding, as well as to have a growth mindset;  
    
*   A discerning mind towards information, ideas and issues;
*   A willingness to acknowledge and respect different perspectives;
*   The humility to reflect on their own learning, mindset and beliefs;
*   A commitment to participate in discussions in a respectful and informed manner;
*   An openness towards managing uncertainties faced in new and unfamiliar contexts;
*   The confidence to be resourceful and adaptable in generating innovative solutions;
*   An appreciation of and an active interest in real-world issues, as well as local and global developments;
*   An appreciation and enactment of their responsibility to make a positive difference.  

#### Approach

ACJC adopts a multi-pedagogical approach in the teaching and learning of PW:

*   Active, collaborative, discovery and interdisciplinary learning takes place during group discussions in the classroom with a dedicated Supervising Tutor facilitating each class and a wifi-enabled learning device supporting each candidate.
*   Workshops to develop students’ process skills are conducted during the PW cycle to support applied learning.
*   Real-world examples of PW, training materials and video tutorials are regularly uploaded to the Student Learning Space (SLS) to facilitate self-directed learning.

##### Programme

Students are assigned to work in project groups within each class, with each project group having 4 to 5 members, and their performance is assessed, both as members of the group and as individuals.

*   Project Summary (30% group marks): Each group is required to submit a Project Summary documenting the real-world problem or opportunity identified, and the proposed ideas to address the project aim. The problem or opportunity, as well as the proposed ideas, are to be analysed and evaluated and supported by research findings.
*   Individual Reflection (20% individual marks): Each candidate is required to submit a written reflection which includes an individual candidate’s analysis and evaluation of group ideas or learning about self in the process of completing the project. Candidates are to generate ideas in the process of their reflection.
*   Oral Presentation (20% group marks + 30% individual marks): Each candidate from the group is given an opportunity to present a part of the project orally to the assessors as audience. This is followed by a group segment where the group responds to questions posed by the assessors.
