### H1 PROJECT WORK (SYLLABUS 8808)

  

##### Aims

  

In today’s dynamic and fast-changing world, students need to learn how to engage with issues, and process cross-disciplinary and open-ended information presented in a less structured manner. Furthermore, due to the ever-changing nature of the workplace, students need to learn to work together on tasks that require a repertoire of skills and to apply what they have learned to complete a group project. It is on this basis that Project Work (PW) was developed and implemented as a compulsory H1 subject and requirement for local university admission.

  

Besides enabling students to acquire 21st century competencies like collaboration, communication and information skills, PW is a learning experience for students to synthesise knowledge from various areas of learning, and critically and creatively apply it to real life situations. Existing in dynamic interplay rather than as compartmentalised and distinct categories, the learning outcomes for PW are:

  

*   **Knowledge Application**: Students acquire the ability to make links across different areas of knowledge and to generate, develop and evaluate ideas and information so as to apply these skills to the project task.
*   **Communication**: Students acquire the skills to communicate effectively and to present ideas clearly and coherently to a specific audience in both the written and oral forms.
*   **Collaboration**: Students acquire collaborative skills through working in a team to achieve common goals.
*   **Independent Learning**: Students learn on their own, reflect on their learning and take appropriate action to improve their learning.

  

##### Approach

  

ACJC adopts a multi-pedagogical approach in the teaching and learning of PW:

  

*   **Active, collaborative, discovery and interdisciplinary learning**&nbsp;takes place during group discussions in the classroom with a dedicated Supervising Tutor facilitating each class and a wifi-enabled laptop supporting each group.
*   Workshops to develop students’ process skills are conducted during the PW cycle to support&nbsp;**applied learning**.
*   Real-world examples of PW, training materials and video tutorials are regularly uploaded to the Student Learning Space (SLS) to facilitate&nbsp;**self-directed learning**.

  

##### Programme

  

Students are assigned to work in project groups within each class, with each project group having 4 to 5 members, and their performance is assessed, both as members of the group and as individuals.

  

*   **Written Report (40% group marks)**: Each group is required to apply the knowledge and written communication skills that they have learned and to demonstrate their abilities collectively in a final product.
*   **Insights &amp; Reflections (10% individual marks)**: Each student is required to analyse and evaluate the information that has been generated as a group or individually in the process of completing his/her task.
*   **Oral Presentation (11% group marks + 39% individual marks)**: Each student is required to display his/her ability to be clear and coherent in presenting a part of the project, to address and engage an audience, and to answer questions posed to him/her. The group mark is given to recognise the group’s ability to be organised and coherent throughout the oral presentation.
