### H1 LITERATURE IN ENGLISH/ H2 LITERATURE IN ENGLISH 

***(New syllabus for students entering College in 2024)***

##### Aims


ACJCs Literature programme aims to develop culturally aware students with a love of reading, an ability to critically examine texts, and the skills and rhetoric essential to develop critical and informed arguments. The teaching programme is designed to develop independent, self-directed learners who are able to think critically. We envision a participatory and collaborative learning environment where teachers facilitate discussion and mutual understanding rather than serve as the sole sources of information. Students who are active in discussion and engaging with their peers will find Literature an enriching experience.

  

We are confident that the fluent communication skills, analytical acumen, and cultural literacy that Literature students will achieve are critical and relevant in fields ranging from business, the professions, academia, and STEM-related careers. The successful student of Literature knows how to analyse any subject, win hearts and minds through a persuasive argument about it, and back this perspective up with rigorous logic.

  

We believe that the study of Literature is ultimately the study of the human condition and that the student of Literature will therefore be well equipped as a conscientious citizen and a thoughtful member of society. They will be challenged and invited to come to their own conclusions about the key themes and concerns of the texts they engage with, and to consider how these lessons are applicable to our own society.

  

There are no specific requirements to take the subject at Higher 1 or Higher 2 level.

  

##### Approach

  

The primary modes of Literature education at ACJC are through tutorials and online learning. Tutorials are interactive and collaborative, with teachers facilitating students’ exploration of texts and ideas. In conjunction with the tutorials, the Department makes extensive use of ICT tools, on which specially created content online lectures are posted, along with worksheets, and uploaded enrichment materials. Lectures are scheduled during revision periods to focus on specific critical content review areas. Assessments include written tests and examinations, written essay assignments, and quizzes.
