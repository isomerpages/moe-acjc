### H1 LITERATURE IN ENGLISH (SYLLABUS 8832) / H2 LITERATURE IN ENGLISH (SYLLABUS 9509)

##### Aims

  

ACJCs Literature programme aims to develop culturally aware students with a love of reading, an ability to critically examine texts, and the skills and rhetoric essential to develop critical and informed arguments. The teaching programme is designed to develop independent, self-directed learners who are able to think critically. We envision a participatory and collaborative learning environment where teachers facilitate discussion and mutual understanding rather than serve as the sole sources of information. Students who are active in discussion and engaging with their peers will find Literature an enriching experience.

  

We are confident that the fluent communication skills, analytical acumen, and cultural literacy that Literature students will achieve are critical and relevant in fields ranging from business, the professions, academia, and STEM-related careers. The successful student of Literature knows how to analyse any subject, win hearts and minds through a persuasive argument about it, and back this perspective up with rigorous logic.

  

We believe that the study of Literature is ultimately the study of the human condition and that the student of Literature will therefore be well equipped as a conscientious citizen and a thoughtful member of society. They will be challenged and invited to come to their own conclusions about the key themes and concerns of the texts they engage with, and to consider how these lessons are applicable to our own society.

  

There are no specific requirements to take the subject at Higher 1 or Higher 2 level.

  

##### Approach

  

The primary modes of Literature education at ACJC are through tutorials and online learning. Tutorials are interactive and collaborative, with teachers facilitating students’ exploration of texts and ideas. In conjunction with the tutorials, the Department makes extensive use of ICT tools, on which specially created content online lectures are posted, along with worksheets, and uploaded enrichment materials. Lectures are scheduled during revision periods to focus on specific critical content review areas. CA assessments include written tests and examinations, written essay assignments, and quizzes.

### H3 LITERATURE IN ENGLISH (SYLLABUS 9823)


  

##### Aims

  

Literature at the H3 level aims to create students who are capable of engaging in independent research, engage critically with primary and secondary sources as well as negotiating different critical approaches to their texts.

  

##### Approach

  

H3 candidates will produce a research paper on a topic and texts of their choice.

  

Students will be guided through the process of crafting a research proposal asserting their initial critical approach to three texts of their choice. They will then embark on expanding this into a research essay. In the course of the crafting of the research essay, students will have up to three conferences with their Research Supervisor to provide feedback on the research essay’s progress.

  

##### Programme

  

The assessment for Literature at the H3 level consists of a research essay of between 3000-3500 words, along with a research proposal and process review document.
