### H2 COMPUTING (SYLLABUS 9569)

##### Aims

Computing at ACJC aims to provide students with 21st century competencies, giving them the knowledge, skills and attitudes to prepare them to address the challenges of the future by harnessing technology effectively. Through the study of Computing, students will gain insights into how common devices used every day actually function, and develop an appreciation for computing innovation. The subject provides a wide range of authentic contexts to develop computing skills and dispositions in our students.

  

The following key ideas are presented in the A Level H2 Computing curriculum to integrate Computing concepts, skills and processes as a coherent whole:

  

*   Computing is a study of problems that can be effectively automated.
*   Computational thinking is the process of identifying computational problems and developing solutions to them.
*   Computational thinking involves problem definition, problem analysis, design and development of solutions and creating a computer-based solution.
*   Algorithms are tools for developing and expressing solutions to computational problems.
*   Programming is a creative process that produces computational artefacts,
*   Computing devices and the networks that interconnect them enable and foster computational approaches to solving problems.

##### Approach

Pedagogical approaches used in Computing include Direct Instruction, Problem-Based Learning and Collaborative Learning. This emphasises the relevance to what “real-world” industry practices are, and require students to use experiential learning to enact authentic scenarios, where students can focus on learning and applying the skills and knowledge they need to solve a problem and implement a project. Problems may be open to multiple interpretations and students are expected to investigate them over a sustained period of time. There may also be diverse interpretations and varied solutions to a single computational problem, instead of one correct answer. Students would also have to deliberate over their choices and reflect on their learning, both individually and collaboratively

##### Programme

  

Students interested in offering Computing must sit for a Computing Proficiency Test during orientation. They have the option of taking either a written test which does not require coding knowledge, or a programming test using Python 3. Only upon clearing the Proficiency Test will they be permitted to offer Computing. Students with a minimum A2 in ‘O’ Level Computing are exempted from the Proficiency Test.&nbsp;**Subject combination restrictions apply to students offering Computing.**

  

The topics covered in H2 Computing include Algorithms and Data Structures, Programming, Data and Information, and Computer Networks. Programming and scripting languages which will be introduced include Python 3, SQL, HTML and Flask.

  

The A Level Examination for H2 Computing comprises one 3 hour written paper with 6-8 structured questions and one 3 hour practical paper with 4 structured questions. Candidates will be expected to answer all questions.
