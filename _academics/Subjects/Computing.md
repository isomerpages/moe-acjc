### H2 COMPUTING (SYLLABUS 9569)

##### Aims

Computing at ACJC aims to provide students with 21st century competencies, giving them the knowledge, skills and attitudes to prepare them to address the challenges of the future by harnessing technology effectively. Through the study of Computing, students will

·       develop computational thinking through problem analysis and evaluation,

·       develop effective problem-solving and systems thinking as they think algorithmically with planning and designing of steps to solve tasks,

·       effectively integrate both hardware and software to create solutions and enhance process efficiency by automating tasks,

·       understand technological advancements and foster an appreciation for innovation,

·       develop 21st century competencies, which comprise a set of knowledge, skills, and attitudes that prepare them to address the global challenges of an increasingly dynamic and interconnected world by harnessing technology.
##### Approach

Pedagogical approaches used in Computing include Direct Instruction, Problem-Based Learning and Collaborative Learning. This emphasises the relevance to what “real-world” industry practices are, and require students to use experiential learning to enact authentic scenarios, where students can focus on learning and applying the skills and knowledge they need to solve a problem and implement a project. Problems may be open to multiple interpretations and students are expected to investigate them over a sustained period of time. There may also be diverse interpretations and varied solutions to a single computational problem, instead of one correct answer. Students would also have to deliberate over their choices and reflect on their learning, both individually and collaboratively

##### Programme

  Students interested in offering Computing must sit for a Computing Proficiency Test during orientation. They have the option of taking either a written test which does not require coding knowledge, or a programming test using Python 3. Only upon clearing the Proficiency Test will they be permitted to offer Computing. 
	
Students with a minimum A2 in ‘O’ Level Computing are exempted from the Proficiency Test. 

Subject combination restrictions apply to students offering Computing.

The topics covered in H2 Computing include:
* Programming Fundamentals
* Data Structures and Algorithms
* Data and Information
* Computer Networks
* Social, Ethical and Security Impact of Computing
* Emerging Technologies

Programming and scripting languages which will be introduced include Python 3, SQL, HTML and Flask.

The A Level Examination for H2 Computing comprises one 3 hour written paper with 6-8 structured questions and one 3 hour practical paper with 4 structured questions. Candidates will be expected to answer all questions.
