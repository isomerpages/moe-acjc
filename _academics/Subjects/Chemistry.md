### H1 CHEMISTRY (SYLLABUS 8873) /H2 CHEMISTRY (SYLLABUS 9729, in 2025; SYLLABUS 9476, from 2026) /H3 CHEMISTRY (SYLLABUS 9813)


##### Aims

The aims of the&nbsp;**H1/ H2/ H3 Chemistry**&nbsp;course are to:

1\. enable students to become scientifically literate citizens who are well-prepared for the challenges of the 21st century

2\. develop in students the understanding, skills, ethics and attitudes relevant to the Practices of Science.

3\. develop the way of thinking to explain phenomena, approach and solve problems in chemical systems which involves students in:

3.1 understanding the structure, properties and transformation of matter at the atomic/molecular level and how they are related to each other

3.2 connecting between the submicroscopic, macroscopic and symbolic levels of representations in explaining and making predictions about chemical systems, structures and properties.

##### Approach

  

Science as a discipline is more than the acquisition of a body of knowledge (e.g. scientific facts, concepts, laws, and theories); it is a way of knowing and doing. It includes an understanding of the nature of scientific knowledge and how this knowledge is generated, established and communicated. Scientists rely on a set of established procedures and practices associated with scientific inquiry to gather evidence and test their ideas on how the natural world works. However, there is no single method and the real process of science is often complex and iterative, following many different paths. While science is powerful, generating knowledge that forms the basis for many technological feats and innovations, it has limitations.

  

The Practices of Science are explicitly articulated to allow teachers to embed them as learning objectives in their lessons. Students’ understanding of the nature and limitations of science and scientific inquiry are developed effectively when the practices are taught in the context of relevant science content. Attitudes relevant to science such as inquisitiveness, concern for accuracy and precision, objectivity, integrity and perseverance should be emphasised in the teaching of these practices where appropriate.

  

The Practices of Science comprise three components: 
<br> 
1\. Understanding the Nature of Scientific Knowledge
<br>
2\. Demonstrating Science Inquiry Skills
<br>
3\. Relating Science and Society

##### Programme

The topics in&nbsp;**H1 Chemistry**&nbsp;are organised as two levels underpinned by the Practices of Science:

(a)&nbsp;**Core ideas**: The three Core Ideas of Chemistry are Matter, Structure and Properties, and Transformation. The concepts in these Core Ideas are interrelated and form the basis for which further learning and understanding of chemical phenomena and reactions is built upon.

(b)&nbsp;**Extension topic**: Concepts in the Core Ideas are applied to real-world context in the study of nanomaterials and polymers.

<u>Indicative Recommendation</u> <br>
*   Pass in ‘O’ Level Chemistry / Pass in Combined Sci with Chemistry


The topics in&nbsp;**H2 Chemistry**&nbsp;are organised as two levels underpinned by the Practices of Science: <br>
(a)&nbsp;**Core ideas**: The three Core Ideas of Chemistry are Matter, Structure and Properties, and Transformation. The concepts in these Core Ideas are interrelated and form the basis for which further learning and understanding of chemical phenomena and reactions is built upon.

(b)&nbsp;**Extension topics**: Concepts in the Core Ideas extend into the learning of different chemical systems such as chemistry of organic compounds and transition elements. As an example, an understanding of concepts of Chemical Bonding and The Periodic Table is extended to the study of the chemistry of transition metals where students learn to appreciate the similarities and differences when comparing with main group metals.

<u>Indicative Recommendation</u> <br>
*   Pass in ‘O’ Level Chemistry / Indicative recommendation min B3 for Combined Sci with Chem


The content topics in&nbsp;**H3 Chemistry**&nbsp;are organised into two levels underpinned by the Practices of Science: <br>
(a)&nbsp;**Core ideas and Extension topics in H2 Chemistry**. These are elaborated in the corresponding H2 Chemistry syllabus.

(b)&nbsp;**Additional content in H3 Chemistry**. Two content areas Spectroscopic Techniques and Further Organic Mechanisms are included to deepen the understanding of the core ideas by expanding the scope for analysis, synthesis and application of concepts.

<u>Requirements to offer H3 Chemistry</u><br>
Excellent results in H2 Chemistry and commendable results in other subjects at the JC1 Promotional Examinations
