• All classes take the form of tutorials in which students are expected to participate&nbsp;actively.

• Classroom activities include group discussion, research assignments, class&nbsp;presentations, etc. There is frequent use of videos, online and ICT resources by&nbsp;teachers to stimulate learning.

• Specially selected resources and customised lessons are uploaded on ICT&nbsp;platforms, such as SLS and Google Classroom, to promote independent learning.&nbsp;Online lessons are also conducted using platforms such as Google Meet or&nbsp;Zoom.

• There are enrichment lectures to broaden students’ content knowledge and to&nbsp;enable them to analyse and evaluate current issues.

• Written assignments are set on a regular basis by class teachers, while tests and&nbsp;exams are conducted at the College level.

• There is a focus on specific themes every term, and reading packages are&nbsp;prepared for students to guide them in their reading and research. These&nbsp;packages contain articles relevant to the themes, mind maps, essential

questions, essay questions, vocabulary, historical timelines, and cultural literacy materials.&nbsp;Students are required to show understanding of the content in these packages in&nbsp;a variety of ways, including mind maps, summarised notes, etc.

• A GP Skills Package is prepared to equip students with the relevant language,&nbsp;research, thinking, and writing skills to handle both Paper 1 and Paper 2.

• Consultations and remedial lessons are conducted to meet the needs of&nbsp;individual students.

• To encourage students to read widely and independently, students are&nbsp;encouraged to subscribe to&nbsp;_TIME_&nbsp;or&nbsp;_The Economist_&nbsp;at the start of JC1.

• Students are encouraged, with guidance provided by teachers, to participate in&nbsp;essay competitions, seminars, and quizzes that are organised by external&nbsp;organisations.
