### Aims


The philosophy of holistic education at Anglo-Chinese Junior College (ACJC) is one that prepares students for life after college through a curriculum aimed at achieving academic excellence and physical well-being.

  

The ACJC PE Programme is structured to prepare students for a lifetime of fit and healthy living. It aims to inculcate an active awareness of the benefits of physical fitness and also to provide students with a framework upon which they may plan and pursue sports and recreational activities hereafter.

  

The aims and objectives of the programme are for students:

*   to develop a healthy level of physical fitness including aerobic efficiency, muscular strength, endurance, flexibility and agility.
*   to acquire knowledge and understanding about the need to adopt a lifestyle which is healthy, in relation to exercise and dietary habits.
*   to learn and develop the ability/skill of swimming in at least one recognised stroke, as part of ensuring water-survival and open up opportunities to other water sports.
*   to participate in both competitive and recreational sports, and
*   to nurture socially approved patterns of personal and interpersonal behaviour such as sportsmanship, leadership and team spirit.

  

### Approaches


Physical Education in ACJC is taught using a variety of approaches ranging from skill development, games concept and differentiated instruction. From 2021, blended learning in PE will be introduced to help students take ownership of their learning and physical fitness. These lessons will incorporate the Health Education Modules, as well as physical fitness to help students develop in 21st Century Competencies.

  

### Programme


Students will undergo a diverse range of modules taught over two years. At the end of JC2, students should have experienced at least a module from each of the categories listed.

  

### GAMES MODULES


Games are essential in the PE Curriculum as they offer a variety of activities that students, having experienced them in PE, may continue to pursue after leaving College. Games are excellent for the development of physical fitness and motor skills. Games also help nurture socially approved patterns of personal and inter-personal behaviour.
