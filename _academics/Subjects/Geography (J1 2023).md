### H1 GEOGRAPHY (SYLLABUS 8813)


  

##### Aims

  

We hope students who go through our programme will emerge as enlightened and responsible inhabitants of our planet Earth. From the multiple perspectives that we hope to inculcate, students may gain insightful understanding of the workings of nature and the close inter-relationship and interdependence of humans and the natural environment. Ultimately, it is our aim that with the deep geographic understanding and insights gained, our students can play integral roles in building physical, social, economic and political spaces that uphold equality, integrity, fairness, and ethical and responsible decision-making, towards the betterment of mankind.

  

### Approach

  

Geography at ACJC runs on a lecture cum tutorial system. With streamlining of timetable and resources, it usually involves one lecture group, and one tutorial group.

  

In the area of Teaching and Learning, there will be greater scaffolding afforded in the first half of JC1, and students will be expected to be progressively more independent and self-motivated over the course of the programme. Lecture notes are made very detailed and comprehensive to enable ease of understanding and revision. Lecture and tutorial resources, videos, quizzes and geography-related articles are made available digitally for ease of reference by students. Student are expected to write short answers to data-response questions, and structured essays on a regular basis as part of the total written assignments. We also provide opportunities for hands-on field investigation for selected topics that are to be covered for Geographical Investigation. Small group consultation and remedial studies are also integral parts of our programme.

  

##### Programme

  

There are three broad Themes in H1 Geography. Theme 1 is focused on some Physical Geography topics, while Theme 2 is focused on some human geography topics. Theme 3 is focused on Geographical Investigation, The topics covered in H1 Geography include: Tropical Climates and Atmospheric Processes, Climate Change, Floods, Sustainable Urban Development, and Liveability in Cities.

  

While developing the geographic perspectives, we strive to equip students with the abilities to:

*   consider evidence and different viewpoints to develop logical arguments and explanations;
*   analyse, evaluate and reflect on information from a geographical perspective to make informed and sound decisions;
*   construct understanding through inquiry using different data collection and analysis methods; and
*   use and evaluate maps and other data representation to integrate information and communicate to a specific audience.

  

Assessment:

The culmination of the programme takes place at the end of the second year of the programme during the ‘A’ Level Examinations where students will sit for one paper of 3 hours where there are three sections.

  

*   Section A tests the component of Geographical Investigation through a data-response question of 25 marks.
*   Section B tests content from either Theme 1 or 2 through a data-response question of 25 marks.
*   Section C requires responses to two Structured Essay questions focusing on Themes 1 and 2, and together carries 50 marks.

H2 GEOGRAPHY (SYLLABUS 9751)
----------------------------

  

### Aims

  

We hope students who go through our programme will emerge as enlightened and responsible inhabitants of our planet Earth. From the multiple perspectives that we hope to inculcate, students may gain insightful understanding of the workings of nature and the close inter-relationship and interdependence of humans and the natural environment. Ultimately, it is our aim that with the deep geographic understanding and insights gained, our students can play integral roles in building physical, social, economic and political spaces that uphold equality, integrity, fairness, and ethical and responsible decision-making, towards the betterment of mankind.

  

### Approach

  

Geography at ACJC runs on a lecture cum tutorial system. Each student will experience two 1-hour lectures and two 1-hour tutorials per week. As we run Themes 1 and 2 simultaneously, a student will be exposed to two hours of Theme 1, and two hours of Theme 2 content per week.

  

In the area of Teaching and Learning, there will be greater scaffolding afforded in the first half of JC1, and students will be expected to be progressively more independent and self-motivated over the course of the programme. Lecture notes are made very detailed and comprehensive to enable ease of understanding and revision. Lecture and tutorial resources, videos, quizzes and geography-related articles are made available digitally for ease of reference by students. Student are expected to write short answers to data-response questions, and structured essays on a regular basis as part of the total written assignments. We also provide opportunities for hands-on field investigation for selected topics that are to be covered for Geographical Investigation. Small group consultation and remedial studies are also integral parts of our programme.

  

### Programme

  

The H2 syllabus content is organised around four themes and designed to be learned within 208 curriculum hours. Guided by geographical concepts, students will learn the syllabus content through geographical inquiry, reading, lectures, and through tutorials.

  

Each theme consists of two integrated topics except for Theme 4, which outlines the skills that students are expected to learn in order to conduct research in areas relevant to what they have learned in Themes 1, 2 and 3.

  

**Theme 1 (Tropical Environments)**&nbsp;helps students to understand the workings of atmospheric, geomorphic and hydrologic processes and associated landforms in the tropics through a systems approach. Students learn about feedback loops to analyse the impact of humans on the environment and how humans are in turn affected by environmental conditions and hazards.

  

**Theme 2 (Development, Economy and Environment)**&nbsp;introduces students to the underlying political and socio-economic structures that determine the kinds of natural resources that are transformed into different kinds of useful products. Through case studies, students gain insights into how political and economic decisions influence society and our environment.

  

**Theme 3 (Sustainable Development)**&nbsp;highlights the importance of exploring how people in different parts of the world are affected when natural environments are exploited. Students confront the contradictions between meeting present needs and achieving intergenerational equity, that is, to pass on the environment in a ‘reasonable condition’ to future generations.

  

While developing the geographic perspectives, we strive to equip students with the abilities to:

*   consider evidence and different viewpoints to develop logical arguments and explanations;
*   analyse, evaluate and reflect on information from a geographical perspective to make informed and sound decisions;
*   construct understanding through inquiry using different data collection and analysis methods; and
*   use and evaluate maps and other data representation to integrate information and communicate to a specific audience.

  

Assessment:

The culmination of the programme takes place at the end of the second year of the programme during the ‘A’ Level Examinations where students will sit for two separate 3-hour papers.

  

Paper 1: Structured Essay Questions

### H3 GEOGRAPHY (SYLLABUS 9822)


  

##### Aims

  

We hope students who go through our portal will emerge as enlightened and responsible inhabitants of our planet Earth. From the multiple perspectives that we hope to inculcate, students may gain insightful understanding of the workings of nature and the close inter-relationship and interdependence of humans and the natural environment. Ultimately, it is our aim that with the deep geographic understanding and insights gained, our students can play integral roles in building physical, social, economic and political spaces that uphold equality, integrity, fairness, and ethical and responsible decision-making, towards the betterment of mankind.

  

##### Approach

  

This programme is meant for students who has the ability to pursue Geography at a more demanding level, and will suit one who has a passion to think geographically. As this is largely a research-based programme, students are expected to display a high level of independence to carry out the necessary primary and secondary research. Guidance from subject mentors are provided in the taught component that will take up about 16 hours of teaching, and two sets of official conferences with the subject mentor.

  

##### Programme

  

The H3 Geography syllabus has been designed to build on and extend the knowledge, understanding and skills acquired from the H2 Geography syllabus. There is topical specialization in the Theme of Sustaintable Development. Hence, the research question need to be related to this topic on sustainability.

  

Once a student has decided on his or her research question, the student then proceeds to complete a proposal and submit it for approval. After approval, the research can be conducted. The independent research conducted by the student will culminate in the writing of the research paper of no more than 3500 words.

  

This process occurs at the start of Year 2, and will culminate in the September of the same year when the independent research essay is submitted for assessment
