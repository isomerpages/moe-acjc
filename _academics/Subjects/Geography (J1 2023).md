### H1 GEOGRAPHY (SYLLABUS 8814)

##### Aims

  

We hope students who go through our programme will emerge as enlightened and responsible inhabitants of our planet Earth. From the multiple perspectives that we hope to inculcate, students may gain insightful understanding of the workings of nature and the close inter-relationship and interdependence of humans and the natural environment. Ultimately, it is our aim that with the deep geographic understanding and insights gained, our students can play integral roles in building physical, social, economic and political spaces that uphold equality, integrity, fairness, and ethical and responsible decision-making, towards the betterment of mankind.&nbsp; In addition, we wish to enable students to think critically about what it means to live sustainably in our tightly interconnected world.&nbsp;&nbsp;  

  

##### Approach

  

Geography at ACJC runs on a lecture cum tutorial system. With streamlining of timetable and resources, it usually involves one lecture group, and one tutorial group.

  

In the area of Teaching and Learning, there will be greater scaffolding afforded in the first half of JC1, and students will be expected to be progressively more independent and self-motivated over the course of the programme. Lecture notes are made very detailed and comprehensive to enable ease of understanding and revision. Lecture and tutorial resources, videos, quizzes and geography-related articles are made available digitally for ease of reference by students. Student are expected to write short answers to data-response questions, and structured essays on a regular basis as part of the total written assignments. We also provide opportunities for hands-on field investigation for selected topics that are to be covered for Geographical Investigation. Small group consultation and remedial studies are also integral parts of our programme.

  

##### Programme

  

There are two broad clusters of topics in H1 Geography.&nbsp;&nbsp;

Cluster 1 is focused on Sustainable Future and Climate Change.&nbsp; Cluster 2 is focused on Fieldwork.&nbsp; The range of topics covered in H1 Geography include: Sustainable Development, Sustainable Cities, Liveable Cities, Causes, Effects and Responses to Climate Change, and Fieldwork.

  

##### Skills

While developing geographic perspectives, we strive to equip students with the abilities to:

* consider evidence and different viewpoints to develop logical arguments and explanations;
* analyse, evaluate and reflect on information from a geographical perspective to make informed and sound decisions;
* construct understanding through inquiry using different data collection and analysis methods; and
* use and evaluate data representation to integrate information and communicate findings.

  

**Assessment:** <br>
The programme culminates at the end of its second year during the ‘A’ Level Examinations where students will sit for one paper of 3 hours where there are three sections.

  

* Section A tests the component of Fieldwork through a data-response question of 30 marks.
* Section B tests content from Cluster 1 through two compulsory structured questions of 22 marks each.
* Section C requires responses to two evaluative essay questions focusing on Cluster 1, with each question carrying 13 marks.&nbsp;

### H2 GEOGRAPHY (SYLLABUS 9173)

  

##### Aims

  

We hope students who go through our programme will emerge as enlightened and responsible inhabitants of our planet Earth. From the multiple perspectives that we hope to inculcate, students may gain insightful understanding of the workings of nature and the close inter-relationship and interdependence of humans and the natural environment. Ultimately, it is our aim that with the deep geographic understanding and insights gained, our students can play integral roles in building physical, social, economic and political spaces that uphold equality, integrity, fairness, and ethical and responsible decision-making, towards the betterment of mankind.  

  

##### Approach

  

Geography at ACJC runs on a lecture cum tutorial system. Each student will experience two 1-hour lectures and two 1-hour tutorials per week.&nbsp;

  

In the area of Teaching and Learning, there will be greater scaffolding afforded in the first half of JC1, and students will be expected to be progressively more independent and self-motivated over the course of the programme. Lecture notes are made very detailed and comprehensive to enable ease of understanding and revision. Lecture and tutorial resources, videos, quizzes and geography-related articles are made available digitally for ease of reference by students. Student are expected to write short answers to data-response questions, and structured essays on a regular basis as part of the total written assignments. We also provide opportunities for hands-on field investigation for selected topics that are to be covered for Geography Fieldwork. Small group consultation and remedial studies are also integral parts of our programme.

  

##### Programme

  

The H2 syllabus content is organised around four topical clusters. Guided by geographical concepts, students will learn the syllabus content through geographical inquiry, reading, lectures, online lessons, and tutorials.

  

Each Cluster consists of two integrated topics except for Theme 4, which outlines the skills that students are expected to learn to conduct research in areas relevant to what they have learned in Clusters 1, 2 and 3.

  

**Cluster 1 (Development, Economy and Environment)**&nbsp;<br>
This cluster allows student to understand the concepts of sustainable development, the way and challenges towards sustainable development, the intertwined relationship between Earth’s resource and Man’s uses and&nbsp;

Management of these resources.&nbsp; Students will also understand the operation of the global economy and how the multiple actors that operate this system could result in distinct spatial and temporal patterns and impacts.&nbsp;&nbsp;

  

**Cluster 2 (Tropical Environments)** <br>
Topic 2.1 focuses on the tropical climates and tropical drainage basins.&nbsp; In this section, students will understand the factors influencing rainfall spatial and temporal patterns, and the factors that affect the operation of the drainage basin hydrological system of the different parts of the tropics.&nbsp; Flooding issues will also be examined in this topic.

  

Topic 2.2 focuses on landforms in the tropics.&nbsp; Students will examine geomorphic processes that shape the landforms, with a focus on river and karst landforms in the humid tropics.&nbsp; There is also a strand which focuses on the relationship between man and specific natural environments in the humid tropics, namely the karst landscape and the deltas.

  

**Cluster 3 (Sustainable Future &amp; Climate Change)** <br>
Topic 3.1 focuses on the topic of Sustainable Future.&nbsp; Students will explore the challenge and opportunities towards making cities sustainable.&nbsp;&nbsp;

  

Topic 3.2 focuses on the topic of Climate Change.&nbsp; Students will learn about contemporary climate change, appreciate the causes and impacts of climate change, and examine possible responses and the challenges of these responses to the issue of climate change.

  

**Cluster 4 (Fieldwork)** <br>
Students will master skills to conduct fieldwork in a few areas related to the specific topics from Clusters 1 – 3.

  

##### Skills

While developing geographic perspectives, we strive to equip students with the abilities to:

* consider evidence and different viewpoints to develop logical arguments and explanations;
* analyse, evaluate and reflect on information from a geographical perspective to make informed and sound decisions;
* construct understanding through inquiry using different data collection and analysis methods; and
* use and evaluate maps and other data representation to integrate information and communicate to a specific audience.

H3 GEOGRAPHY (9822)
-------------------

  

### Aims

  

We hope students who go through our course will emerge as enlightened and responsible inhabitants of our planet Earth. From the multiple perspectives that we hope to inculcate, students may gain insightful understanding of the workings of nature and the close inter-relationship and interdependence of humans and the natural environment. Ultimately, it is our aim that with the deep geographic understanding and insights gained, our students can play integral roles in building physical, social, economic and political spaces that uphold equality, integrity, fairness, and ethical and responsible decision-making, towards the betterment of mankind.

  

### Approach

  

This programme is meant for students who have the abilities to pursue Geography at a more demanding level,&nbsp; and will suit those who have a passion to think geographically. As this is largely a research-based programme, students are expected to display a high level of independence in carrying out the necessary primary and secondary research. Guidance from subject mentors is provided through the taught component that will take up about 16 hours of teaching, and two sets of official conferences with the subject mentor.

  

### Programme

  

The H3 Geography syllabus has been designed to build on and extend the knowledge, understanding and skills acquired from the H2 Geography syllabus. There is topical specialization in the Theme of Sustainable Development. Hence, the research question needs to be related to sustainability.

  

Once a student has decided on their research question, the student then proceeds to complete a proposal and submit it for approval. After approval, the research can be conducted. The independent research conducted by the student will culminate in the writing of the research paper of no more than 3500 words.

  

This process occurs at the start of Year 2, and will culminate in September of the same year when the independent research essay is submitted for assessment.
