<h3>H1 GEOGRAPHY (SYLLABUS 8834)</h3>
<h5>Aims</h5>
<p>We hope students who go through our programme will emerge as enlightened
and responsible inhabitants of our planet Earth. From the multiple perspectives
that we hope to inculcate, students may gain insightful understanding of
the workings of nature and the close inter-relationship and interdependence
of humans and the natural environment. Ultimately, it is our aim that with
the deep geographic understanding and insights gained, our students can
play integral roles in building physical, social, economic and political
spaces that uphold equality, integrity, fairness, and ethical and responsible
decision-making, towards the betterment of mankind.&nbsp; In addition,
we wish to enable students to think critically about what it means to live
sustainably in our tightly interconnected world.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h5>Approach</h5>
<p>Geography at ACJC runs on a lecture cum tutorial system. With streamlining
of timetable and resources, it usually involves one lecture group, and
one tutorial group.</p>
<p>In the area of Teaching and Learning, there will be greater scaffolding
afforded in the first half of JC1, and students will be expected to be
progressively more independent and self-motivated over the course of the
programme. Lecture notes are made very detailed and comprehensive to enable
ease of understanding and revision. Lecture and tutorial resources, videos,
quizzes and geography-related articles are made available digitally for
ease of reference by students. Student are expected to write short answers
to data-response questions, and structured essays on a regular basis as
part of the total written assignments. We also provide opportunities for
hands-on field investigation for selected topics that are to be covered
for Geographical Investigation. Small group consultation and remedial studies
are also integral parts of our programme.</p>
<h5>Programme</h5>
<p>There are two broad clusters of topics in H1 Geography.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cluster 1 is focused on Sustainable Future and Climate Change.&nbsp; Cluster
2 is focused on Fieldwork.&nbsp; The range of topics covered in H1 Geography
include: Sustainable Development, Sustainable Cities, Liveable Cities,
Causes, Effects and Responses to Climate Change, and Fieldwork.</p>
<h5>Skills</h5>
<p>While developing geographic perspectives, we strive to equip students
with the abilities to:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>consider evidence and different viewpoints to develop logical arguments
and explanations;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>analyse, evaluate and reflect on information from a geographical perspective
to make informed and sound decisions;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>construct understanding through inquiry using different data collection
and analysis methods; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>use and evaluate data representation to integrate information and communicate
findings.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Assessment:</strong> 
<br>The programme culminates at the end of its second year during the ‘A’
Level Examinations where students will sit for one paper of 3 hours where
there are three sections.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Section A tests the component of Fieldwork through a data-response question
of 30 marks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Section B tests content from Cluster 1 through two compulsory structured
questions of 22 marks each.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Section C requires responses to two evaluative essay questions focusing
on Cluster 1, with each question carrying 13 marks.&nbsp;</p>

<h5>Approach</h5>
<p>Geography at ACJC runs on a lecture cum tutorial system. Each student
will experience two 1-hour lectures and two 1-hour tutorials per week.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the area of Teaching and Learning, there will be greater scaffolding
afforded in the first half of JC1, and students will be expected to be
progressively more independent and self-motivated over the course of the
programme. Lecture notes are made very detailed and comprehensive to enable

hands-on field investigation for selected topics that are to be covered
for Geography Fieldwork. Small group consultation and remedial studies
are also integral parts of our programme.</p>
<h5>Programme</h5>
<p>The H2 syllabus content is organised around four topical clusters. Guided
by geographical concepts, students will learn the syllabus content through
geographical inquiry, reading, lectures, online lessons, and tutorials.</p>
<p>Each Cluster consists of two integrated topics except for Theme 4, which
outlines the skills that students are expected to learn to conduct research
in areas relevant to what they have learned in Clusters 1, 2 and 3.</p>
<p><strong>Cluster 1 (Development, Economy and Environment)</strong>&nbsp;
<br>This cluster allows student to understand the concepts of sustainable
development, the way and challenges towards sustainable development, the
intertwined relationship between Earth’s resource and Man’s uses and&nbsp;</p>
<p>Management of these resources.&nbsp; Students will also understand the
operation of the global economy and how the multiple actors that operate
this system could result in distinct spatial and temporal patterns and
impacts.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Cluster 2 (Tropical Environments)</strong> 
<br>Topic 2.1 focuses on the tropical climates and tropical drainage basins.&nbsp;
In this section, students will understand the factors influencing rainfall
spatial and temporal patterns, and the factors that affect the operation
of the drainage basin hydrological system of the different parts of the
tropics.&nbsp; Flooding issues will also be examined in this topic.</p>
<p>Topic 2.2 focuses on landforms in the tropics.&nbsp; Students will examine
geomorphic processes that shape the landforms, with a focus on river and
karst landforms in the humid tropics.&nbsp; There is also a strand which
focuses on the relationship between man and specific natural environments
in the humid tropics, namely the karst landscape and the deltas.</p>
<p><strong>Cluster 3 (Sustainable Future &amp; Climate Change)</strong> 
<br>Topic 3.1 focuses on the topic of Sustainable Future.&nbsp; Students will
explore the challenge and opportunities towards making cities sustainable.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Topic 3.2 focuses on the topic of Climate Change.&nbsp; Students will
learn about contemporary climate change, appreciate the causes and impacts
of climate change, and examine possible responses and the challenges of
these responses to the issue of climate change.</p>
<p><strong>Cluster 4 (Fieldwork)</strong> 
<br>Students will master skills to conduct fieldwork in a few areas related
to the specific topics from Clusters 1 – 3.</p>

<h3>H3 GEOGRAPHY (9822)</h3>
<h5>Aims</h5>
<p>We hope students who go through our course will emerge as enlightened
and responsible inhabitants of our planet Earth. From the multiple perspectives
that we hope to inculcate, students may gain insightful understanding of
the workings of nature and the close inter-relationship and interdependence
of humans and the natural environment. Ultimately, it is our aim that with
the deep geographic understanding and insights gained, our students can
play integral roles in building physical, social, economic and political
spaces that uphold equality, integrity, fairness, and ethical and responsible
decision-making, towards the betterment of mankind.</p>
<h5>Approach</h5>
<p>This programme is meant for students who have the abilities to pursue
Geography at a more demanding level,&nbsp; and will suit those who have
a passion to think geographically. As this is largely a research-based
programme, students are expected to display a high level of independence
in carrying out the necessary primary and secondary research. Guidance
from subject mentors is provided through the taught component that will
take up about 16 hours of teaching, and two sets of official conferences
with the subject mentor.</p>
<h5>Programme</h5>
<p>The H3 Geography syllabus has been designed to build on and extend the
knowledge, understanding and skills acquired from the H2 Geography syllabus.
There is topical specialization in the Theme of Sustainable Development.
Hence, the research question needs to be related to sustainability.</p>
<p>Once a student has decided on their research question, the student then
proceeds to complete a proposal and submit it for approval. After approval,
the research can be conducted. The independent research conducted by the
student will culminate in the writing of the research paper of no more
than 3500 words.</p>
<p>This process occurs at the start of Year 2, and will culminate in September
of the same year when the independent research essay is submitted for assessment.</p>
