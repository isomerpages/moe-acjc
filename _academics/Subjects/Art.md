**Aims**

Art at 'A' Level offers students a comprehensive curriculum, balancing art making and art discourse. It is a unique and liberating experience where students can literally "do whatever they want to actualise their vision". 

The syllabus aims to develop in each student: 
an inquiring mind and the confidence to express artistic intent through visual language, 
visual literacy and critical thinking skills, 
an active imagination and a spirit of experimentation and adaptation to discover creative possibilities artistic agency and capacity for reflective and collaborative practice; and an understanding of and readiness to embrace diverse perspectives in art from a range of local and global contexts.

**Approach**

Our curriculum is customised to the interests and abilities of each student, and aims to stretch their potential through embracing inquisition, independent research, and guided risk taking! 


At H1 level, students develop professional art critique skills through the Art discourse module, analyzing and evaluating artworks in various cultural and historical contexts. 


At H2 level, students are empowered to develop their artistic practise and identity through building an art portfolio. We expose learners to a wide range of mediums and techniques through studio practice and master classes, and embark on learning journeys to experience art in the real world. Graduates showcase their body of work through SONDER, an annual exhibition at our very own art gallery. 


H3 Art extends from the H2 Art syllabus by laying a foundation for those seeking academic engagement in Art at the tertiary level. It offers intellectual challenge and rigour as it expects students to think independently and develop critical inquiry. It takes the form of a taught element and a Research Essay on a topic of the students’ choice.
