##### Aims

### H1 BIOLOGY (SYLLABUS 8876)


H1 biology at ACJC aims to instill in students a broad sense of appreciation and awe for biological nature and for them to use their biological knowledge in their everyday life.  

  
We envision each H1 biology student developing their interest in biology and building the knowledge, skills and attitudes to be scientifically literate, and to be ready for the challenges of the 21st century. We want to develop students’ understanding, skills, ethics and attitudes relevant to the practices of science so that they will be able to address the broader questions of what life is and how life is sustained.

Pass in combined science with biology


### H2 BIOLOGY (SYLLABUS 9744)


H2 biology at ACJC aims to develop in students the disciplinary understanding, skills and attitudes necessary to pursue careers in biology-related fields.  

In addition to the desired student outcomes described for H1 biology, we hope to inculcate in every H2 biology student a global outlook, equipped with adequate biological knowledge, rigour and skills to understand happenings in the scientific world. The teaching program is designed to train and equip students with critical thinking skills and to be effective communicators of science.

### H3 BIOLOGY (SYLLABUS 9816)


The H3 biology syllabus aims to cater to students with a strong foundation in H2 biology and keen to pursue a more comprehensive understanding of the discipline in both depth and breadth.  

  

We envision each H3 biology student deepening their knowledge and skills, and fostering attitudes necessary for further studies in biology-related fields; developing the skills to think deeply, laterally and critically about biological issues; critically analysing information by building well-structured arguments that integrate knowledge and skills acquired from different areas of biology; and developing the skills needed for effective engagement in scientific discourse.
