### PHYSICS H1/H2/H3


  

##### Aims

  

### H1 PHYSICS (SYLLABUS 8867)


Physics at ACJC aims to instill in students a love for the sciences and skills such as investigation, application of patterns, models, principles theories and laws to become confident citizens in a technological world.  

  

It will enable students to become scientifically literate citizens who are well-prepared for the challenges of the 21st century. It also aims to develop the understanding, skills, ethics and attitudes relevant to the Practices of Science in our students. This includes understanding the nature of scientific knowledge, demonstrating science inquiry skills, relating science to society. It also aims to develop in students an understanding that a small number of basic principles and core ideas can be applied to explain, analyse and solve problems in a variety of systems in the physical world.

  

Requirements

Pass in ‘O’ Level Physics OR

Pass in Combined Science with Physics

  

### H2 PHYSICS (SYLLABUS 9749)


Physics at ACJC aims to instill in students a love for the sciences and skills such as investigation, application of patterns, models, principles theories and laws to become confident citizens in a technological world.  

  

Based on the syllabus, the course aims to provide students with an experience that develops their interest in Physics and builds the knowledge, skills and attitudes necessary for further studies int will enable students to become scientifically literate citizens who are well-prepared for the challenges of the 21st century. It also aims to develop the understanding, skills, ethics and attitudes relevant to the Practices of Science in our students. This includes understanding the nature of scientific knowledge, demonstrating science inquiry skills, relating science to society. It also aims to develop in students an understanding that a small number of basic principles and core ideas can be applied to explain, analyse and solve problems in a variety of systems in the physical world.

  

Requirements

Pass in ‘O’ Level Physics OR

Indicative recommendation of min B3 for Combined Science with Physics

  

### H3 PHYSICS (SYLLABUS 9814)


The aims of a course based on this syllabus is to provide students an experience that deepens their knowledge and skills, foster attitudes necessary for further studies in related fields, develop in students their appreciation of the practice, value and rigour of physics as a discipline. It aims to develop in students the skills to analyse physical situations and to apply relevant concepts and techniques, including calculus, to solve problems.  

  

Requirements

Excellent results in H2 Physics and commendable results in other subjects at the JC1 Promotional Examinations

  

##### Approach

  

### H1 PHYSICS (SYLLABUS 8867)


The teaching programme is designed to develop independent and self-directed learners who are able to think critically through interactive and collaborative tutorial classes which incorporate scientific inquiry, use of ICT, demonstrations and more.  

  

Students are expected to be disciplined and take responsibility for their own learning. Lessons will be delivered via tutorial-based sessions and differentiated lesson material will be used to cater to the readiness of the students. Various revision material will also be made available for various assessments throughout the two years. Finally, consultation sessions will also be conducted by tutors to meet the needs of individual students.

  

### H2 PHYSICS (SYLLABUS 9749)


The teaching programme is designed to develop independent and self-directed learners who are able to think critically through interactive and collaborative tutorial classes which incorporate scientific inquiry, use of ICT, demonstrations and more.  

  

Students are expected to be disciplined and take responsibility for their own learning. Lessons will be delivered via both lectures and tutorials and differentiated lesson material will be used to cater to the readiness of the students. Various revision material will also be made available for various assessments throughout the two years. Science practical work will also be conducted to support students' learning of science. Practical work will hone their experimental techniques, practical manipulative skills and conceptual understanding. Consultation sessions will also be conducted by tutors to meet the needs of individual students.

  

### H3 PHYSICS (SYLLABUS 9814)


Students are expected to be disciplined and take responsibility for their own learning. Lesson material will be provided to the students and students are expected to study and attempt the accompanying tutorial independently based on a specific schedule. Small group weekly or fortnightly consultations sessions will also be conducted by tutors to address the queries of individual students.  

  

##### Programme

  

### H1 PHYSICS (SYLLABUS 8867)


H1 Physics is assessed through 2 papers. Paper 1 (1 h, 30 marks) will consist of 30 compulsory multiple-choice questions. Paper 2 (2 h, 80 marks) will consist of 2 sections. Section A worth 60 marks consisting of a variable number of structured questions including one or two data-based questions, all compulsory. Section B worth 20 marks consisting of a choice of one from two 20-mark questions.  

  

H1 Physics provides students with a thorough understanding of the main principles and experimental skills that are fundamental to the subject in the area of Measurements, Newtonian Mechanics, Electricity and Magnetism and Nuclear Physics.
