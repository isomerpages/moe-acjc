##### Assessment

  

Students are tested on two papers which are taken at separate sittings within the same day.

Paper 1 Essay (1h 30min) – Paper 1 comprises 12 questions on issues drawn from across disciplines and of local interest and global concern. Students are to answer only one question.

  

Paper 2 Comprehension (1h 30min) – Paper 2 comprises one or two text passages. There will be a range of questions on the text(s), requiring students to demonstrate their ability to comprehend, explain, infer, evaluate and summarise. The application question requires students to respond to a task derived from the text(s), based on their understanding and interpretation of the text(s) as a whole.

  

##### Approach

  

*   All classes take the form of tutorials in which students are expected to participate actively.
*   Classroom activities include group discussion, research assignments, class presentations, etc. There is frequent use of videos, online and ICT resources by teachers to stimulate learning.
*   Specially selected resources and customised lessons are uploaded on ICT platforms, such as SLS and Google Classroom, to promote independent learning. Online lessons are also conducted using platforms such as Google Meet or Zoom.
*   There are enrichment lectures to broaden students’ content knowledge and analyse and evaluate current issues.
*   Written assignments are set on a regular basis by class teachers, while tests and exams are conducted at the college level.
*   There is a focus on specific themes every term, and reading packages are prepared for students to guide them in their reading. These packages contain articles relevant to the themes, mind maps, essential questions, essay questions, vocabulary, historical timeline, and cultural literacy. Students are required to show understanding of the content in these packages in a variety of ways, including mind maps, summarised notes, etc.
*   A GP Skills Package is prepared to equip students with the relevant language, research, thinking and writing skills to handle both Paper 1 and Paper 2.
*   Consultations and remedial lessons are conducted to meet the needs of individual students.
*   To encourage students to read widely and independently, students are encouraged to subscribe to TIME or The Economist at the start of JC1.
*   Students are encouraged, with guidance provided by teachers, to participate in essay competitions, seminars, and quizzes that are organised by external organisations.
