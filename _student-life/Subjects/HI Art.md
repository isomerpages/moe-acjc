### H1 ART (SYLLABUS 8879)

##### Aims

  

Art at ACJC is a holistic and robust programme that nurtures artistic interest in every student and allows them to gain a deeper appreciation for the visual arts. We believe that each student is unique and therefore our programme is designed to stretch their potential by catering to a wide range of interests and abilities.

  

The Higher 1 (H1) Level Art syllabus is designed to provide opportunities for students at the pre-university level to broaden their engagement in the visual arts. Students offering the H1 Level Art syllabus will investigate artistic conventions and concepts through the study of artists and artworks. Visual literacy skills, such as perception of and response to visual images, as well as critical analysis of visual information, are also developed.

  

The aims of the syllabus are to:

*   cultivate deeper understanding and appreciation of visual arts within social and cultural contexts
*   develop visual literacy through the critical analysis and appraisal of artists and artwork
*   increase proficiency in the use of visual arts vocabulary
*   foster self-confidence and a sense of achievement through critical appraisal of the visual arts
*   nurture a lifelong interest in the visual arts.

##### Approach

We want our students to investigate artistic conventions and concepts through the Study of Visual Arts (S.O.V.A) research. S.O.V.A research emphasises the development of inquisitive and critical thinking skills. It equips students with art terminology and skills to respond more effectively to various artworks. These learning experiences inculcate in students a greater appreciation for the visual arts and its role in society.

  
A variety of teaching, learning and assessment modes are used:

*   Content lectures and readings
*   Individual or group research
*   Class discussions and critiques
*   Individual or group presentations
*   Learning journeys to museums, galleries, exhibitions and festivals (subject to timetabling conditions)

### Programme

<u>Paper 1: Study of Visual Arts</u>

This is a two-year course in which we aim to nurture visual literacy by taking a systematic approach to Art criticism through formal analysis - description, analysis, interpretation and evaluation. At the end of the course, students will develop a vocabulary to discuss works of art and be able to appreciate Art and its role in society.

At the end of the two-year period students will sit for a 3 hour written paper. They are expected to respond to one question from each section A, B, C. There are thirty marks for each question (90 marks in total).

## H2 ART (SYLLABUS 9750)


  

##### Aims

  

Art at ACJC is a holistic and robust programme that nurtures artistic interest in every student and allows them to gain a deeper appreciation for the visual arts. We believe that each student is unique and therefore our programme is designed to stretch their potential by catering to a wide range of interests and abilities.

  

The Higher 2 (H2) Level Art syllabus is designed to provide students with an in-depth study in the visual arts. Through art making, students will be able to explore a wide variety of media and technologies to solve problems through critical thinking, experimentation and innovation.

  

In addition to the practical experiences, students will investigate artistic conventions and concepts through the Study of Visual Arts component. Visual literacy skills, such as perceiving and responding to visual images, and analysis of visual information, are further enhanced and developed in this syllabus.

  

The aims of the H2 Art syllabus are to:

*   cultivate deeper understanding and appreciation of visual arts within social and cultural contexts
*   encourage experimentation and innovation through exploration and creative use of materials and processes
*   increase proficiency in the use of art and design principles to communicate ideas and concepts
*   develop critical and analytical skills through research, exploration and creation of artworks
*   foster self-confidence and a sense of achievement through the practice of visual arts
*   lay the foundation for lifelong interest in the visual arts.

##### Approach

  

We customise our lessons and resources around the needs of the learner to give all students a chance to explore a wide range of artistic experience. Our emphasis is on freeing students to develop their own creative ‘voice’ through researching, visualizing and articulating ideas.

  

In the first year, we put our students through a foundation programme comprising a rigorous research exercise where they are taught and exposed to a wide range of mediums to help them identify their areas of interest. We adopt an art journaling practice using the **S.E.E** approach, which is an acronym for **Sensing**, **Experimenting** and **Evaluating**, that aims to cultivate the culture of inquisition, independent research and risk-taking. We gave our students the liberty to design their own artistic experiences where they can explore their respective fields to further sharpen their ideas and hone their skills.

  

In addition to practical experiences, students will investigate artistic conventions and concepts through the Study of Visual Arts (S.O.V.A) research. S.O.V.A research emphasises the development of inquisitive and critical thinking skills. It equips students with art terminology and skills to respond more effectively to various artworks. These learning experiences inculcate in students a greater appreciation for the visual arts and its role in society.

Paper 1: Study of Visual Arts

At the end of the course, students will develop a vocabulary to discuss works of art and be able to appreciate Art and its role in society.

  

Paper 2: Coursework

Students will explore issues that are current and relevant to social and cultural context, while making connections between their own experiences and the issues encountered by artists within their own culture. Along with the creative process of making Art, students will develop a series of preparatory studies for every theme selected. For the A Level examination students are expected to produce one project and submit a maximum of eight A2 boards of preparatory studies.

  

At the end of the two-year period, in addition to submitting their project and preparatory work, students will sit for a 3 hour written paper. They are expected to respond to one question from each section A, B, C. There are thirty marks for each question (90 marks in total).

  

Final grades are based on the following:

Coursework 60%

Study of Visual Arts 40%
