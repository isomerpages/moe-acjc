### H2 MUSIC (SYLLABUS 9753) and H3 MUSIC (SYLLABUS 9819)

##### Aims

  

ACJC MEP aims to develop students’ passion, sensorial abilities and musical creativity, and to empower them to appreciate and participate in music at an advanced level. 

  

The course is designed to:

• Develop musical skills, knowledge and understanding

• Develop advanced skills of communicating, collaborating and expressing musical ideas and understanding

• Develop an enduring understanding and appreciation of the diverse local and global musical cultures

• Develop critical and creative thinking in music

• Develop independent learners with inquiring and innovative minds through reflective practices in music

• Provide the basis for an informed, life-long appreciation and active involvement in the arts

  

##### Approach

  

ACJC Music Elective Programme focuses on three domains of music: Listening, Creating and Performing 

  

Students explore a range of traditional and contemporary genres and styles as they discuss music-related issues and analyse music. As aural skills are developed, students gain an understanding of the distinctive characteristics of music cultures in Singapore and the world. This helps to lay the foundation for further study in music at the tertiary level. 

  

There are also opportunities to engage in creative musical making and collaborations. In Creating, students are able to explore a range of traditional and contemporary compositional styles. Students would also be able to use technology in composing.

  

Students’ solo and chamber performance skills are honed in a group setting as they discourse about their personal interpretation of pieces in their repertoire and provide peer feedback.

  

Students are also encouraged to satisfy their musical curiosity and develop a range of analytical, inquiry and research methods as they embark on their independent H3 research under the guidance of their supervising tutors.

##### Enrichment

  

Beyond classroom learning, students are exposed to a wide-range of enrichment activities, including lectures, masterclasses and workshops with local and international professors and practitioners. The programme offers many platforms for musical expression, ranging from regular in-house recitals to public performances. Outstanding students in the field of performance have opportunities to be featured as a concerto-soloist, while aspiring young composers may have their original works premiered at concerts.

  

One unique ACJC MEP-xperience is our annual recital @artikulation, where present and past students of the programme come together to present an evening of solo and chamber music. Through this musical interaction, students are able to relate with and gain value musical insights from their peers and seniors.

  

Over the years, the programme has groomed many students to continue their pursuit of music in both local and overseas conservatories and universities. Many of our alumni have been awarded scholarships and bursaries in their respective universities.
