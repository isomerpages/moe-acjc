### I. AIMS AND PHILOSOPHY

The College believes that every student is able to achieve self-discipline. Our approach and rules are guided by several principles, and these include:

*   Alignment with College Vision, Mission and Values.
*   Fairness and consistency.
*   Proportionality.
*   Upholding the needs and interests of the College community.

  

The goals of our disciplinary approach are to:

*   Nurture personal responsibility and self-discipline so that our students make responsible decisions.
*   Foster a conducive environment for teaching and learning.

  

We believe that student reflection is important, so that our students can reflect on the impact that their actions have on others, and nurture greater self-management. To encourage student reflection, we engage students through the W.A.R.M. strategy – W (What happened), A (Affect), R (Reflect and Repair), M (Moving Forward).

### VI. PENALTIES

<u>Demerit point system</u><br>
The penalty for infringement of any of the above rules and regulations will take the form of a demerit point system, where demerit points will be given accordingly. Points issued will range from 1 to 12 accumulated over the time spent in ACJC.

  

All teachers are responsible for implementing the system in their roles as disciplinarians. They will issue on-the-spot correction as an initial measure. In the event that the student fails to abide by the rule, the teacher will then issue demerit points according to the guide given in the following table. Teachers are to report all infringements of rules and regulations to the Vice-Principal or any of the Discipline Masters/Mistresses who will then deal accordingly with the recalcitrant student.

  

As a guide, the following is a list of offences and the respective demerit points:

  

|  | Offence | Points |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Late for school | 1\* |
| 2 | Absent from class without a valid reason | 1 |
| 3 | Improper dress code for various College activities/functions | 1 |
| 4 | Long hair/untidy hairstyles | 1 |
| 5 | Failure to comply with specific instructions | 1 |
| 6 | Absent from college without a valid reason | 1 |
| 7 | Leaving college without prior permission from the Principal/Vice-Principal/DM/Class teacher before stipulated times | 3 |
| 8 | Misconduct (i.e. rude/defiance, talking in the library, eating/drinking outside canteen area, rowdy behaviour or any such conduct unacceptable to an atmosphere for study and learning, inappropriate social media posts, and so on) | 1-3 |
| 9 | Littering and failure to return empty plates and cutlery to receptacles. | 1 |
| 10 | Dishonesty i.e. incessant lying, plagiarism, cheating in exams/test, falsifying reports, documents and certificates. | 6-12 |
| 11 | Failure to show proper conduct at flag raising ceremony or absence from college functions without valid reason. | 12 |
| 12 | Vandalism and graffiti | 12 |
| 13 | Smoking/consumption of drugs/glue sniffing | 12 |
| 14 | Stealing | 12 |
| 15 | Extortion and threatening behaviour | 12 |

  

\* One demerit point for every three late-comings.

  

Certain measures will be taken when a student accumulates the following number of points:

*   5 points onwards – Parents/Guardians will be notified.
*   9 points onwards – Suspension from classes up to a maximum of 7 days.
*   12 points – Dismissal from College. No testimonial will be issued to the student at the end of his/her two years in the College.

  

While the above demerit points serve as a guide to the College’s implementation of the system, the Principal reserves the sole right to issue the points as and when she deems fit, according to the severity of the offence.
