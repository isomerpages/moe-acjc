<h3>I. AIMS AND PHILOSOPHY</h3>
<p>The College believes that every student is able to achieve self-discipline.
Our approach and rules are guided by several principles, and these include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Alignment with College Vision, Mission and Values.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fairness and consistency.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Proportionality.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Upholding the needs and interest of the College community.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The goals of our disciplinary approach are to:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Nurture personal responsibility and self-discipline so that our students
make responsible decisions.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Foster a conducive environment for teaching and learning.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We believe that our students are ambassadors of the College, who are expected
to uphold the College’s values and represent the College with pride and
dignity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To ensure that they fulfil this role, we believe that student reflection
is important, so that our students can reflect on the impact that their
actions have on others, and nurture greater self-management. To encourage
student reflection, we engage students through the W.A.R.M. strategy –
W (What), A (Affect), R (Reflect and Repair), M (Move forward) approach.</p>
