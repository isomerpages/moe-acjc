### Science Experience

All ACJC Science students engage in meaningful hands-on Science activities planned by the respective departments and lectures by invited researchers during Science Week. The ACJC Science Experience promotes enduring understanding and appreciation of the Nature of Science.

### Science Enrichment

Curated learning journeys and workshops in our Post-Promos Science Fun excite our Science students as they learn the science of making bread, chocolate and essential oils, 3D printing with our in-house machine and many more interesting activities!

### Science Excellence

The ACJC Science Excellence programme started with the General Science Research Education in 2011. It aims to enhance our student researchers’ competencies in understanding research methodologies, ethics, scientific writing and poster presentation. Eligible ACJC Science students can apply for the following research programmes:

*   Nanyang Research Programme (NRP)
*   Science Research Programme (SRP)
*   A\*STAR Science Award (JC) – Research Attachment Programme (RAP)
*   Local Student Attachment Programme (LSAP)
*   Overseas Student Attachment Programme (OSAP)

Under the mentorship of international scientists at various renowned agencies, such as Agency for Science technology and Research (A\*STAR), Nanyang Technology University (NTU), and National University of Singapore (NUS), our students can pursue their passions in science and engineering projects. The College encourages and prepares our research students to showcase their research findings in-house at our Innovation and Research Fair, as well as participate in the annual Singapore Science and Engineering Fair (SSEF).
