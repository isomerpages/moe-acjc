Character Education in Anglo-Chinese Junior College is aligned to the College’s vision of “Noble Ambition and Character, for the service of God and nation”. As such, the College believes in cultivating students of sound character based on the College values of integrity, tenacity and passion.

  

ACJC’s character development framework, which is adapted from Thomas Lickona’s theoretical model, approaches character education at two levels. At the classroom level, every teacher is a role model who imparts values and social emotional skills through academic subjects and CCP lessons (or life skills lessons). At the College level, values are imparted through the establishment of a moral culture, active engagement with parents and the community and Co-Curricular Programmes (CCP).

  

For character education to be effective, there is active communication of the College vision, mission and values between the school leadership and the stakeholders — namely the students, teachers, parents and alumni. As the stakeholders identify with the school values, there are opportunities for them to apply and embody such values in activities like the weekly chapel service, morning devotions, assembly talks and College events. A caring College environment is provided so that students feel secure and supported as they learn and mature. At the same time, disciplinary structures in the College encourage and reinforce responsible decision making. In this way, a moral culture is evolved.

  

Co-Curricular Programmes play a major role in shaping the values of the students. Every student is expected to participate in at least one Co-Curricular Activity, to actively serve the community and to gain leadership experience. The College systems facilitate this learning process. CCAs ensure that all clubs and societies, sports, and performing arts incorporate values and socio-emotional skills in their training and activities. The college encourages all students to put their values into action through active service to the school, and the wider community. As the college believes that every student is a leader, leadership programmes are college-wide with compulsory and elective modules, and opportunities are provided for students to apply their leadership skills. Opportunities for reflection on learning are structured into lessons and school experiences, and time is set aside for teachers to provide developmental feedback to help students grow in their character journey.

  

Another important dimension of ACJC’s character development framework is the engagement with parents and alumni who play an important role in helping the school in character education and are role models for the students. Parent volunteers meet regularly to pray for our students, and provide dinner for those who do their revision in school prior to the year-end examinations. They host the international scholars who are far from home and share with them the local cultures and practices. Our alumni also provide vital support in our endeavour to develop students’ character skills and knowledge. The college invites our alumni as speakers at various platforms to share their experiences as leaders or pioneers in their respective fields, imparting important values and principles of leadership.

  

Above all, what distinctly shapes the character of ACJC students lies in the school motto “The Best Is Yet To Be”. The College believes that our students have the capacity to overcome challenges, and to always improve, striving for excellence. ACJC seeks to instill this principle in all its students.
