### Aims

What does it mean to be an active citizen?

  

In ACJC, this means that our students must be able to

*   Have a broad worldview
*   Work with people of different cultures
*   Be cognizant of national issues and international issues affecting Singapore
*   Understand what it means to be a Singaporean
*   Be an active contributor to the community.

  

### Approach

We adopt a two-pronged approach in our active citizenry programme.

  

Firstly, through the commemoration of key National Education (NE) events, SG Perspectives dialogue sessions with senior civil servants and ministers, and other class-based NE activities, we encourage our students to develop:

*   A sense of belonging to the community and the nation
*   A sense of reality about the issues affecting Singapore
*   A sense of hope that Singaporeâ€™s future will continue to be bright
*   The will to act and to contribute to the community.

  

Secondly, Values In Action (VIA) is key to the development of this active citizen, as it

*   Provides a platform for students to move from a self-centric to community-centric disposition
*   Creates opportunities for collaboration
*   Provides an experiential learning journey for them to discover the needs of Singaporeans and thereafter a platform to make a difference.
