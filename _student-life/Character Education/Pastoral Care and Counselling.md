### Aims

Pastoral care and counselling aims to meet the social and emotional developmental needs of students by:

·       Inculcating values that promote personal well-being

·       Learning to be a positive receiver and contributor within an environment of care

·       Building confidence through personal awareness

·       Acquiring high levels of social-emotional competencies and lifeskills in managing various aspects of development as a young adult

·       Intervention and restoration for vulnerable students through counselling

The above aims will holistically enable students to cope with personal, social and academic challenges.

  

### Approach

3.      Pastoral Care involves taking a student-centered approach in developing programmes that are customised to the profile of students at ACJC.
