## <center> Literature Enrichment with Dr Andrew Hui </center>

On Friday 18 May, the ACJC Literature department were honoured to welcome a guest lecturer, Dr Andrew Hui, Assistant Professor of Literature at Yale-NUS College. Dr Hui, who specialises in the Classical tradition in European Renaissance culture, addressed the Humanities class, 2AH, on&nbsp;_The Tempest: Between Antiquity and Modernity_.

  

Dr Hui traced the theses of the Tempest in the light of how European civilization constructed itself, and in the way it began to forge an identity in relation to the wider world, opened up to Europe during the Age of Discovery. He extended the discussion to another set text, Christopher Marlowe's&nbsp;_Dr Faustus_, drawing links between the two protagonists, Faustus and Prospero.
