## <center> ACSian Theatre Performs! </center>

The month of March 2018 has been an eventful and exciting one for ACSian Theatre.

  

On 1st March 2018, ACSian Theatre was given the privilege to perform two dance items – _Hand Clap_, and _This is Me_ – for the ACS 132nd Founder’s Day Celebration Dinner at Shangri-La.

  

_Hand Clap_ was an upbeat flash mob put together to reflect the strong sense of school pride and togetherness, while _This is Me_ encapsulated the spirit of tenacity and passion that ACSians believe so strongly in. The performance served as a meaningful way for the club to express our gratitude and give back to the ACS family.

  

ACSian Theatre was also invited to perform at the National Book Council’s All In! Young Writers Festival on the 17th March 2018. Along with Hand Clap and This is Me, the club also performed an upbeat Bollywood-style dance, titled _Radha on the Dance Floor_.

The Young Writers Festival is an annual event held by the National Book Council to celebrate and inspire the young writers of today, and ACSian Theatre is honoured to have been given the opportunity to perform at such a meaningful event.

We would like to thank our teachers, choreographers, and alumni for their steadfast support and encouragement. We would also like to extend our sincere gratitude to the ACS OBA and the National Book Council for giving us the chance to perform at these events.

To God Be the Glory,

The Best is Yet to Be!
