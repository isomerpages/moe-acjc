On the 9th March 2018, the Drama and Art Elective Programme students collaborated for an interactive learning experience.

  

The lesson centred around Art Elective Programme alumnae Gillian Gohâ€™s art piece. Drama Elective Programme and ACSian Theatre alumni Chiara Lim and Ng Jia Le performed a movement sequence within the art installation as a physical interpretation and response to the work.

  

The lesson was a meaningful opportunity for students from the different artistic disciplines to come together and learn from one another. It was also an interesting opportunity to explore ways in which art and theatre can interweave and grow together.

  

In the same month, ACSian Theatre also had the chance to host students from Commonwealth Secondary School during their rehearsals, as part of their efforts to reach out to other schools in the West Zone to share their love for theatre.

  

This experience enabled them to work together with theatre students from other schools and share their experiences and practices with them. ACSian Theatre feels privileged to be given the opportunity to collaborate with other schools and looks forward to being able to do so again.
