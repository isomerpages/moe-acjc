Between 5th to 7th April, the ACJC Debate and Oratorical Society organised and participated in the international Oldham Cup, a debate competition that saw 50 teams from countries such as China, India, Nigeria and Thailand compete alongside debaters from various local junior colleges, secondary schools, and also the Singapore National Team. The teams engaged in intellectual discourse on issues such as whether professional sports team owners should be allowed to sanction players for political expression, and whether we should support the creation and adoption of cryptocurrencies.

Eventually after 8 rounds of arduous debates spanning 3 days, RIJC B took home the championship trophy, with Team China A being crowned as the best performing international team as well as 1st runners-up. The two ACJC teams also performed exceptionally well in the competition, winning most of their rounds and putting up a good fight against debate heavyweights.  

  

We are glad that participants, team managers, and coaches found the 3 day tournament enriching and many had a chance to hone their debating skills in this competition. On top of that, local and international teams had the chance to deepen cross-cultural ties and see different ways of persuasion and argumentation.

The club would like to thank our principal, Dr Shirleen Chee, for gracing the event. We would also like to extend our appreciation to our teachers for their support and guidance throughout the event, our coach Samuel Myat San for working tirelessly with us and guiding us every step of the way, as well as volunteers from ACJC who extended their help, making Oldham Cup 2018 a success. Last but not least, we would like to thank God for His grace and providence, without whom none of these would have been possible.
