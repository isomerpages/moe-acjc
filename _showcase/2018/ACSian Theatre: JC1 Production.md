## <center> ACSian Theatre: JC1 Production </center>

On the 6 and 7 of August, ACSian Theatre’s J1 batch of 2018 staged our first club production, performing Bang Bang, You’re Dead. The play was written by William Mastrosimone in April 1999, in the wake of a 1998 school shooting by a high school student in Springfield, Oregon. It was intended to serve as an avenue for those affected to seek resolution, and in the long run, to increase awareness of school violence.

Under the professional eye of ACSian Theatre’s Alumni, the cast and crew produced a dynamic and invoking ensemble piece. Bang Bang, You’re Dead revolves around Josh, a high school shooter, alternatingly played by four performers. The performers captured the vulnerability, the confliction, and the rage Josh experienced leading up to the shooting, the eerie manifestations of Josh’s subconscious, and the devastating repercussions of his actions.

The show would not have been possible if not for our seniors, our teachers, Mrs Geetha Creffield, Ms Michelle Wong Mr Tobias Teo, Mdm Baljeet Kaur and Ms Low Tze Hui, as well as our beloved alumni, Chiara, Cassandra, Jesslyn, Reuben, and Jit who mentored us over the past 3 months. We would also like to thank our audience for their support and ardent response in the post-show talk-back session. Last but not least, we would like to credit our success to God, whose name we continue to work in and glorify.
