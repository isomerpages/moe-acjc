## <center> ACJC COE Retrospective 2018 </center>

As the West Zone Centre of Excellence for Language Arts, ACJC is delighted to have had an exciting programme of activities in 2018. The highlights of the year included ground breaking digital initia-tives such as the humanities magazine Unwrap being designed and launched for all schools as well as live performances and debate and public speaking activities. ACJC was delighted to have with us varied audiences and participants who were engaged and passionate about the plethora of events hosted by ACJC.

  

**Theatre and Performance**

The year began with laughter. Barrel of Laughs V3.0â€”a fourth-wall breaking, meta play about a drama society was staged by ACSian theatre and alumni. Full of shenanigans and Farcical irreverent humour, the play was loved by audiences of all ages.
