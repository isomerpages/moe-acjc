Orator’s Trophy 2018, organised by Anglo-Chinese Junior College’s Debate and Oratorical Society, proved to be an immense success with judges and spectators awed by the phenomenal quality of the speeches delivered by speakers of all age groups. This year, Orator’s Trophy attracted a record-breaking number of participants in light of the launch of the new Pre-University League alongside the existing Junior and Senior Leagues, which drew in a sizeable pool of speakers who added colour and diversity to the competition with their oratorical flair.

  

This year, our impassioned speakers delivered their similarly compelling speeches on a wide spectrum of topics, ranging from cautionary and aphoristic wisdom to even the more personal topics which prompted much soul-searching indeed. Speakers were brimming with brilliant ideas and even well-timed humour, sharing their witty and incisive commentary on gripping topics such as "You can't make an omelette without breaking a few eggs" and "Not all who wander are lost".

  

Most of all, speakers benefited immensely from the guidance and advice offered by judges, allowing them to further hone their talent as aspiring public speakers.

  

Dr Shirleen Chee, the College’s Principal and our Guest of Honour, graced the Grand Finals of Orator’s Trophy with her concluding address on the art of speaking and urged our young participants to keep at their quest for mastery over the spoken form.

  

We look forward to seeing you at Orator’s Trophy 2019!
