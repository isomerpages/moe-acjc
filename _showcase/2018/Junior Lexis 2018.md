Anglo-Chinese Junior College’s Junior Lexis 2018 proved to be a major success, with primary school students from 20 schools across Singapore joining us for 3 fruitful, fun-packed sessions on the art of debate. With exciting motions such as THBT Pokémon GO brings about more harm than good, Junior Lexis 2018 provided students with an enriching learning opportunity under the aegis of the Debate and Oratorical Society’s experienced debaters. Catering to a spectrum of students of diverse backgrounds and experience levels, the sessions focussed on the fundamental elements of debate necessary to lay down a solid foundation for the young debaters, providing new and more experienced debaters alike with a holistic approach to the art.
