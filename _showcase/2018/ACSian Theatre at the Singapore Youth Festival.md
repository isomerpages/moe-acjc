Presented on 25 April 2018, ACSian Theatre performed a devised physical theatre piece, The Conference of The Birds. Created through workshop and devising, the item was inspired by the Persian poem of the same name by Farid ud-Din Attar and tells the story of a flock of birds who embark on a journey to find enlightenment.

The dynamic conception of the piece was displayed through physical stunts and lifts, and crystallised through selected text and natural sounds produced by the actors themselves. The cast worked tirelessly on the physically intensive piece, under the precise artistic direction of choreographic and directorial team, whose enthralling vision elevated the item to greater heights.

The piece was performed for the Singapore Youth Festival 2018 Arts Presentation for Drama, at which the team received an Accomplishment. We would like to express our deepest gratitude for our teachers, Mrs Geetha Creffield, Ms Michelle Wong, Mr Tobias Teo, Ms Low Tze Hui and Mdm Baljeet Kaur, for their unwavering support and kind guidance, as well as to our dedicated choreographer, Dr Filomar Tariao Cortezano. We lift this performance to God, whose light has never failed to shine upon us throughout the arduous but fulfilling journey.

_We are just at the beginning of our journey.â€™_
