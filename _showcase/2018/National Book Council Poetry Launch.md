## <center> National Book Council Poetry Launch </center>

In Term 3, the JC1 Drama Elective Programme (DEP) students were honoured to be a part of the National Book Council's launch of Second Persons, Singaporean poet Aaron Maniam’s second poetry collection.

  

The experience is definitely not one that will be easily forgotten as the DEP J1s went through the gruelling process of creating devised movement to fit Mr Maniam’s poetry.

  

Since idea of presenting text and movement simultaneously was new to us, we required much practice to ensure that both our words and actions carried the same affective weight to reach out and touch our audience through physical translation of our interpretations of the poems. Moreover, as an ensemble, we strengthened our ability to feel each other’s energy. This enabled us to collectively present a performance that spoke to the audience.

Overall, it was a challenging yet fruitful and fresh experience that was appreciated by both the poet and his audience. We thank our School Leaders, Teachers, choreographers, and of course Mr Maniam, for this wonderful opportunity.
