_Congratulations to the ACJC Cross Country Girls for placing in the Top 4!_

The ACJC Cross Country teams of 8 boys and 8 girls participated in the A-Division Cross Country Championships on 21st March this year where the girls ran 3.8 km and the boys ran 4.8 km. Both the boys and girls team fought hard to compete with 143 runners and 152 runners respectively with more than 16 teams per category.

The Girls' A division team has managed to achieve a commendable 4th team placing amid fierce competition in the 2018 National School Games.

  

The Cross Country CCA would like to thank the coach for his tactful guidance and for pushing them beyond their comfort zones and strive for excellence as well as the teachers-in-charge for their frequent encouragement and for always being the pillars of strength. Also, thanks to Vice-Principals Mrs Lee and Ms Yee for their support during the race. Lastly, our Heavenly Father who watched over the teams and held them in the palm of His hands throughout every Cross Country training and who will continue to watch over the juniors as they train hard and get back stronger next year.
