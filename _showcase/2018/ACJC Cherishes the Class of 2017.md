## <center> ACJC Cherishes the Class of 2017 </center>

On the 23rd of February 2018, Anglo-Chinese Junior College received the GCE A-level results for the Class of 2017. During their 2 years at ACJC, the students of the Class of 2017 have distinguished themselves on the playing field, in performances, in clubs and societies, in academics, and in their service to others. The College gives thanks for each and every one of them.

As ACSians we cherish our College values of Integrity, Tenacity and Passion. In line with this ethos, we would like to highlight the following students, exemplary ACSians one and all, who were outstanding role models during their time at the college.
