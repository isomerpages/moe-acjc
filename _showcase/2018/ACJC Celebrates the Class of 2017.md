_<center>The Class of 2017, taking centre stage</center>_

On the 23rd of February 2018, Anglo-Chinese Junior College (ACJC) received the GCE A-level results for the Class of 2017. The College is proud to announce that the Class of 2017 have achieved excellent results and set new benchmarks for their juniors in overall passes, distinctions and mean A-level points.

  

Of the subjects offered at the H2 level, over half had percentage passes at or above the national average, with nearly two thirds gaining percentage distinctions at or above the national average. All subjects offered at H1 level including Project Work, had percentage passes at or above national average, with more than four fifths gaining percentage distinctions at or above the national average.

  

During their 2 years at ACJC, the members of the Class of 2017 have distinguished themselves on the playing field, in performances, in clubs and societies, in academics, and in their service to others. The College gives thanks for each and every one of them. We will be sharing some of their stories in an upcoming article.

  

The College would like to thank all who have played a part in the success of the Class of 2017: our dedicated staff, the ever-supportive parents of the Class of 2017, and the wider ACS and Methodist family.

  

Most of all, we give thanks to God for His infinite goodness.

  

_To God be the Glory! The Best is Yet to Be!_
