MUSE was a unique collaboration between the Anglo-Chinese Junior College Concert Band and ACSian Theatre. With 3 solo pieces along with an ensemble performance, ACSian Theatre (plus Alumni) learned about music-making with a Concert Band. We also experienced the rare privilege of singing at the Esplanade.

With the continuous support of the Alumni and Teachers, ACSian Theatre gave spectacular performances of musical theatre renditions. Firstly, RENT’s famous ‘Seasons of Love’ was sung as an ensemble piece followed by a melodic song entitled ‘Someone like You’ from the musical Jekyll and Hyde by Mrs Tan Yi Wen. ‘Confrontation’, from the same musical, was a powerful performance sung by Timothy Chang. The night ended for ACSian Theatre with Nathania Ong’s performance of ‘Poor Monty’ where she wowed the audience with her wide vocal range. Through this event, ACSian Theatre are proud to have been able to work with the school’s Concert Band, strengthening the ACJC performing arts community.

  

ACSian Theatre would like to extend our heartfelt gratitude to Mr Adrian Poon, our voice coach, as well as the Anglo-Chinese Junior College Concert Band and their conductor, Mr Alvin Seville, for giving us an opportunity to perform alongside them at a world-class venue on the Esplanade stage, and for the wonderful chance to make music together. We look forward to similar collaborations in the future!
