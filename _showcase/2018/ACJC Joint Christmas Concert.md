## <center> ACJC Joint Christmas Concert </center>

On 24th November 2017, the Anglo-Chinese Junior College Harp Ensemble, String Ensemble and Choir had the honour of performing at JTC Biopolis.

  

This performance was particularly special because the 3 Performing Arts groups collaborated to present a musical blessing to the office lunch crowd. It was a meaningful experience for the musicians and choristers to bring joy during this festive season. The preparation process has helped the groups to grow in cohesion and independence as they worked with each other on honing their pieces. It was certainly heart-warming to see the relaxed faces of the audience as they enjoyed the rich melodies and harmonies of the euphonious offerings.

  

Members of the 3 groups also came together to rehearse and present combined pieces such asÂ _All I Want For Christmas is You and The Prayer_, and this has certainly forged deeper bonds between the PA groups. The success of this collaboration should serve to create greater confidence for more of such in the future, helping to increase the interest in and visibility of the arts in both the College and the community.
