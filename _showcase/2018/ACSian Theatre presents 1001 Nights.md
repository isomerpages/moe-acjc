On the 24th and 25th of November, ACSian Theatre presented One Thousand and One Nights, a collection of Middle Eastern folk tales from the Islamic Golden Age.

  

The cast engaged the audience in this interactive play following Scherezade in her attempts to prevent Sharyar from killing her by telling him stories. It explores various themes of moral values, generosity, ethics and love through her stories and is accompanied with drums, oud and the triangle which contributed to the soundscape.

The ensemble cast poured their heart and soul into their first major production. The costumers played an imperative role in uplifting the aesthetics of the characters with the numerous eye-catching costumes. The crew were also crucial in ensuring the smooth operations backstage.

The show would not have been possible without the teachers’ guidance and relentless support throughout this journey. We would also like to thank the DSAs, and interns from Mayflower Secondary for their assistance. We thank the audience as well for gracing this event and their warm reception. Last but not least, we give all glory to God, for blessing all of us throughout this journey.
