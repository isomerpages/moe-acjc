The ACJC Tamil Language Society (TLS) made it to the finals of an National Tamil Debate Competition, also known as Surabi. Surabi is an event organized by National Junior College, in view of the month-long Tamil Language Festival, intending to enhance the use and proficiency of Tamil among students.

  

Team ACJC competing at Surabi 2018 comprised of five students, Hasmath Thameena from 1SC7, Selvam Lavanya from 1SC3, Valliappan Kasi T. from 1SB6, Subramanian Alagappan from 1SB8, and Syasya D/O Sayed Rajak from 2MD1. After the preliminary rounds, quarter-finals and semi-finals, the ACJC Tamil debaters emerged as 1st Runners-Up against the defending champions, AJC.

  

The motion of the day was “Internet censorship is very important in this century”, and ACJC was the proposition team. After half an hour of heated debate, ACJC lost marginally to AJC, but nevertheless emerged as National Runners-Up.

  

The TLS feels extremely privileged to have been given a chance to take part in this major competition. It has taught us to be critical and to approach issues with different perspectives. In addition, it has definitely allowed us to hone our Tamil Language proficiency. Not only that, we were also able to bond together as a CCA and form lasting friendships.

This competition enabled ACJC TLS to uphold its core values, while strengthening and further developing our friendships with fellow Tamil speakers from the other Junior Colleges.

We would like to thank Mdm Ramani Gopalan, Teacher-in- charge of the Tamil Language Society for her training, mentorship and encouragement throughout the competition. She has always been there for us. We would also like to thank all AC TLS Alumni for helping us through this three-month journey of preparation and for coming down to spar with us. We finally thank the school leaders for their neverending encouragement.
