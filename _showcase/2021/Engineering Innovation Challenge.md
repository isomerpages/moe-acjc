## <center>Engineering Innovation Challenge</center>

The Engineering Innovation Challenge 2021 is jointly organised by the Institution of Engineers, Singapore (IES) and Science Centre Singapore, with the support of the Ministry of Education, and sponsored by the National Research Foundation. The theme was “Radiation 360°”.  

One team of three students (Dylan Tay, Yaw Dong Jeun and Qian Xin) represented ACJC and participated in this competition. The team developed their idea of a CT Scanner with more radiation emitters in order to shorten the exposure time for patients during a scan, and hence reduce overall exposure to radiation. They had the privilege of being mentored by Mr Syed Mubarak Bin Subukutheen, and the opportunity to attend many workshops on product and prototype development, coding; learning more about engineering in the process. The team was shortlisted for the Final Round, in which they created a prototype CT Scanner, and produced a video explaining it.

The Challenge has provided our students a platform where they can learn from the local experts how Physics and Engineering concepts apply to various fields and industries. We congratulate the team in winning the Merit award at the EIC 2021!

“We are extremely happy and thankful to receive this award. We would like to thank our mentor and teacher in-charge for helping us through our journey in the competition. We worked together really well and by leveraging on one another's strength, we were able to come up with and make a product that can help the medical industry. To God be the Glory, the Best is Yet To Be!” – Team’s Reflection
