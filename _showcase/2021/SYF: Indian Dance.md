Challo, Challo! 

On 13 April 2021, ACSian Theatre participated in the Indian Dance category of the Singapore Youth Festival Presentation 2021, clinching a Certificate of Distinction. The performance, titled “CHALLO! Bollywood NOW!”, featured a mashup of Bollywood and contemporay music, allowing us to stand out and entertain the online audience and judges while showcasing different forms of traditional Indian dance, such as Bhangra and Bharatanatyam.

Despite none of us having prior experience in the art form, we approached the experience with open minds guided by our wonderful choreographer Gerald Sebastian Raj. Our trainings were exhilarating, and we were happy to learn new skills.
