Challo, Challo!&nbsp;

On 13 April 2021, ACSian Theatre participated in the Indian Dance category of the Singapore Youth Festival Presentation 2021, clinching a Certificate of Distinction. The performance, titled “CHALLO! Bollywood NOW!”, featured a mashup of Bollywood and contemporay music, allowing us to stand out and entertain the online audience and judges while showcasing different forms of traditional Indian dance, such as Bhangra and Bharatanatyam.

Despite none of us having prior experience in the art form, we approached the experience with open minds guided by our wonderful choreographer Gerald Sebastian Raj. Our trainings were exhilarating, and we were happy to learn new skills.

We were also fortunate to be able to do a two-day masterclass with Indian dance specialist Madam Vasugidvi where we acquired a deeper appreciation for the classical dance forms, allowing us to perform our fusion dance piece in a respectful and engaging manner. Despite various challenges, we persevered together as a team, and ultimately managed to dazzle on the stage wearing the school colours of red, blue and gold !

We extend our deepest gratitude to Mrs Geetha Creffield, Ms Michelle Wong, Ms Annabel Tan, Mr Tobias Teo, Mdm Baljeet Kaur and Mr Jeremy Wong for making this experience a memorable one.
