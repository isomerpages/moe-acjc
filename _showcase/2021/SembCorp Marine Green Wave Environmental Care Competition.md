The Green Wave Environmental Care Competition 2021/2021 is organised by Sembcorp Marine which aims to care for, protect and build our environment through innovative solutions and ideas.&nbsp;

  

Two pairs of students represented ACJC in this competition. Chua Kai Xiang and Anirudh Mannattil submitted a proposal on the “Sustainable Conservation of Birds (particularly the Straw-Headed Bulbul)”, and Tan Yun Ning Germayne and Lam Wan Ying submitted a proposal on the “Conservation of Clementi Forest”. 13 JC/ITE projects were shortlisted for the Final Round, and the project on “Conservation of Clementi Forest” was one of them.

  

Germayne and Wan Ying prepared for their presentation and defended their ideas in front of a panel of judges amidst their A-Levels examinations. We are happy to announce that they are awarded the Commendation Award, as well as the Team Award in the competition.

  

“Taking part in this competition was certainly very fruitful and eye opening—In particular, presenting our ideas and discussing them with experts from related fields gave us greater insights beyond that of a student, allowing us to better understand the concerns of various stakeholders involved when it comes to the conservation of Clementi forest.” – Germayne Tan, 2MD4 Class of 2021

  

“Other than time management, I learnt that conservation wasn’t simply about environment, it was also linked to many other fields like Economics.” – Lam Wan Ying, 2AD3 Class of 2021
