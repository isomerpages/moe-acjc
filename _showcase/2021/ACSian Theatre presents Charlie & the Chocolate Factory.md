## <center> ACSian Theatre presents Charlie &amp; the Chocolate Factory </center>

On the 24th of July 2021, ACSian Theatre held a dramatised script reading session as part of ‘Read! Fest - Read for Books’, a charity book drive organised by the National Library Board (NLB). This Values-In-Action activity was conducted with an online zoom reading of ‘Charlie and the Chocolate Factory’, a stage adaptation of Roald Dahl’s classic children’s novel.

The play follows Charlie’s wondrous journey into Mr. Willy Wonka’s fantastic factory of sweet treats and surprises. With creatively crafted props, costumes and virtual backgrounds, members of ACSian Theatre came together to create meaningful theatre with adherence to Safe Management Measures. The Zoom recording was made freely available for West-Zone schools to be entertained by the heart-warming and hilarious story of a poor boy with a love of chocolate.&nbsp;

  

All in all, the remarkable story of Charlie, and the interesting diversity of characters made for a fun and meaningful afternoon. On behalf of the club, we would like to thank our teachers for assisting us in this activity as well as fellow members for their enthusiastic participation in this activity.

  

To God be the Glory, the Best is Yet to Be!
