“Better a witty fool, than a foolish wit!”   
On the 8th, 9th and 10th of April, ACSian Theatre staged a contemporary interpretation of ‘Twelfth Night‘, a fast-paced romantic comedy by William Shakespeare.

The audience watched a a love triangle between Viola, Orsino, and Olivia and an incredible journey of chaos, hilarity and excitement.

With five fantastically choreographed dance numbers in tandem with stunning lighting, ACSian Theatre’s cast and crew poured their hearts out into the production; illuminating the stage, and pulling the audience into the world of Illyria with their vibrant and electrifying energy. 


This, together with the brilliant comic timing of lines and the depth of the emotions portrayed, truly breathed life into the characters and the story, making Twelfth Night a huge success.

This production would not have been possible without the wholehearted support and hard work of our teachers and instructors, Mrs Geetha Creffield, Ms Michelle Wong, Mr Gerard Sebastian Raj, Ms Anna Tan, Mdm Baljeet Kaur and Mr Tobias Teo.
