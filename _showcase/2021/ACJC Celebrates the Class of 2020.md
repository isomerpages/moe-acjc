The College is proud to announce that  the Class of 2020 have achieved excellent results, a true testament to their hard work, dedication, and determination. Based on the MOE indicator of “percentage of candidates obtaining at least 3 H2 passes, with a pass in GP or KI”, 97.7% of our 745 students achieved this, surpassing the national average of 93.6%. With regard to quality of performance, the Class of 2020 has indeed performed well in terms of the numbers of students scoring at least 3 H2 distinctions. The College is also delighted that the first cohort of H2 Computing students have performed very well. The Mean Ranking Points for the cohort also leaves them well-positioned for the way forward.
