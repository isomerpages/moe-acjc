The College is proud to announce that  the Class of 2020 have achieved excellent results, a true testament to their hard work, dedication, and determination. Based on the MOE indicator of “percentage of candidates obtaining at least 3 H2 passes, with a pass in GP or KI”, 97.7% of our 745 students achieved this, surpassing the national average of 93.6%. With regard to quality of performance, the Class of 2020 has indeed performed well in terms of the numbers of students scoring at least 3 H2 distinctions. The College is also delighted that the first cohort of H2 Computing students have performed very well. The Mean Ranking Points for the cohort also leaves them well-positioned for the way forward.

They quickly re-designed Orientation 2020 to ensure that their juniors had an enjoyable and safe introduction to ACJC. During full home-based learning, they worked with discipline and a cheerful attitude, keeping their eyes fixed on their goal. They came up with inventive ways to continue their co-curricular activities and programmes on virtual platforms. Some examples included the International Oldham Cup 2020, which garnered over 500 participants and 100 judges, working on-line using Zoom and Google Meet. Teams crossed time zones that varied across 8 hours GMT to debate with each other. The finals were livestreamed internationally. The Science and Maths Council organised their inaugural Sci-Teens Challenge, a Science digital video competition to engage students to utilise various ICT tools to explain scientific phenomenon in a novel and innovative manner.

Despite the pandemic, the Class of 2020 embarked on community projects like AC Care as part of the Be Kind SG’s efforts to convey Singapore’s gratitude to our healthcare workers. They took the opportunity to appreciate our cleaners. Each class designed a poster to show their appreciation for the school cleaners who had to step up tremendously to ensure that the College is well-sanitised to combat the COVID-19 virus and a group also organised a small appreciation tea session and presented a gift pack for each of the cleaners. Another notable project was the collaboration with our brother schools from ACS (Barker), ACS (Junior) and ACS (Primary) to bless the foreign dormitory workers at Chancery Court, Dunearn Road.
