Singapore Science &amp; Engineering Fair 2021 (SSEF 2021)The Final Judging Round of Singapore Science &amp; Engineering Fair 2021 was held online on 31st March. The SSEF 2021 is a national competition organised by the Ministry of Education (MOE), the Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A\*STAR) and the Science Centre Singapore for students to showcase their passion in research and communicate their findings to experts from the industry. The Final Judging Round comprised two segments. In the first segment, finalists submitted a project presentation document, a quad chart and a two-minute video. The second segment required them to attend a live virtual session to answer questions posed by the expert judges.&nbsp;

This year, ACJC submitted 7 projects, of which 5 were shortlisted for the Final Judging Round.

Our finalists were:

**Aaron Wee Zhi Rong (2MD1):**&nbsp;Simulations of Periodic Lens Panels for Even Distribution of Light in Vertical Farms

  

**Libut Jaztynn Phoemela Barairo (2SC1):**&nbsp;Vision-Based Intelligence towards Self-Driving Vehicles (with&nbsp;Chua Yong Liang &amp; Sampson Bong Shung Hoong of RVHS)

  

**Lek Wing Chung, Eugene (2SA1):**&nbsp;VAE-U-nets: Addressing the weaknesses of GANs used for image resolution enhancement

  

**Liang Yusen (2SA5) &amp; Lee Jia Qing (2SB2):**&nbsp;Future of solar energy: Global optimisation of all perovskite tandem solar cells through artificial intelligence

  

**Ong Jia Cheng (2SA4) &amp; Teoh Jian Jia (2SB1):**&nbsp;An evaluation on the object detection performance of DETR for remote sensing

We are pleased to share that Liang Yusen and Lee Jia Qing won the Merit Award and Special Award given by the Electrochemical Society, Singapore Chapter. In addition, Lek Wing Chung, Eugene won the Silver Award.&nbsp;

  

“Learning opportunities through this journey were not limited to broadening my knowledge, allowing me to see how far I could push my discipline and time management skills, through taking on this project.&nbsp;It also forced us to think outside the box for new creative ways to tackle the main issue in our research project, while making us think critically to optimise our solution.” – Liang Yusen

  

“Despite all the difficulties when planning and conducting our research, I feel strongly that my research journey was indeed an interesting and meaningful one. It provided numerous opportunities for me to acquire and develop many important hard and soft skills, including coding, report-writing, effective communication and teamwork. These 21st-century skills would help facilitate my future studies and even career, allowing for better adaptation to the fast-changing learning and working environment.” – Lee Jia Qing

  

“First important learning point would be teamwork. This event had given me the opportunity to work with peers from different schools. We had different ideas that we shared with one another, that, if not managed well, could give rise to conflicts. Thus, we had to make sure to create a safe space for one another to share our ideas, but also allow our ideas to come together to bloom into a solution that is better than each of our ideas alone. Not only did we learn to communicate well with one another, we also learnt to communicate our ideas to other people. Although we had to truncate our scripts to meet a limited time, it didn’t mean we had to know less of what we were talking about- it meant that we should know our topic inside-out to be able to represent it succinctly.” – Jaztynn
