On the 15th of May 2021, the Drama Elective Programme (DEP) Class of 2022 performed their first examination showcase titled “Theasthai”. Each member of the class performed a short monologue of their choosing and worked hard over the course of 2 months to put up an artistically truthful performance while adhering to the ongoing Safe Management Measures.

The actors performed pieces from a variety of genres. There were hilarious comedies with characters ranging from an arrogant actor, trying to land a leading role, to a woman, petrified by the prospects of dating. There were also emotional and thought-provoking monologues that conveyed important messages like cherishing your loved ones and the struggles of assimilation. The class enjoyed holistically putting theory into practice to create meaningful storytelling.&nbsp;
	


The class would like to express our gratitude to Mrs Geetha Creffield, Ms Michelle Wong, Ms Annabel Tan, and all the seniors who helped us.&nbsp; Their invaluable contributions helped to make our first performance showcase a memorable event. We would also like to thank our school leaders, teachers , parents and friends for all their tremendous support.&nbsp;

  

To God Be The Glory, The Best Is Yet To Be !&nbsp;
