They made the most of their time in spite of the challenges created by the pandemic, and have left their mark on the College. Each member of the cohort is special.

Evan’s leadership extended beyond ACJC as he volunteered with the Boys’ Brigade (BB). He served as the Head Primer of the 12BR Singapore Company based in Anglo-Chinese School (Barker Road). In this capacity, he led over twenty volunteers in mentoring and guiding nearly 80 secondary school students weekly.
