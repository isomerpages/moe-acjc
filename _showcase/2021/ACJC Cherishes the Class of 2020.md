## <center> ACJC Cherishes the Class of 2020 </center>

During their time at ACJC the Class of 2020 lived out the College values of Integrity, Tenacity, Passion, in Order to Make a Difference. They made the most of their time in spite of the challenges created by the pandemic, and have left their mark on the College. Each member of the cohort is special. Here, we highlight a few exemplary ACSians from the Class of 2020.

**Chloe Lee Xue Ning**<br>
<img src="/images/Chloe%20Lee.jpeg" style= "width: 30%; margin-right:15px;" align = "left"> Chloe was the Valedictorian of the Class of 2020. As Vice-President of the 44th Students’ Council, Chloe demonstrated outstanding leadership. She chaired the committee that organised Seniors’ Night 2019, coordinating the efforts of different teams to ensure a memorable evening for the Class of 2019. In the 2019 ACJC CCA Advisory Board (CCAAB) Camp organised by the College to develop student leaders, Chloe was awarded the Best Girl Camper in recognition of her leadership abilities. In 2020 she mentored the JC1 Students’ Council nominees and collaborated with different departments to create several publicity videos for the event. Her interest in mentoring others is unsurprising as she hopes to pursue teaching as a future career. In order to learn more about teaching, she participated in the Ministry of Education (MOE) Student Mentorship Programme 2020. She takes service to heart, and took a key role in ACares 2020, a Values-In Action (VIA) project to express gratitude to Singapore’s healthcare workers during the pandemic. 


**Evan Lim Shouwang**<br>
<img src="/images/Evan%20Lim.jpeg" style= "width: 30%; margin-right:15px;" align = "right"> Evan was the President of the 44th Students’ Council. Evan’s calm demeanour came to the fore in leading the Council through the challenges posed by COVID-19. He led his team of Councillors and Orientation Group Leaders (OGLs) to make decisive well-rationalised modifications to the Orientation 2020 programme despite receiving news of the COVID-19 safety guidelines the evening before the Orientation. The JC1 students were made to feel a part of the ACJC family even as necessary measures meant that they were not able to assemble together as a full school. Evan’s leadership extended beyond ACJC as he volunteered with the Boys’ Brigade (BB). He served as the Head Primer of the 12BR Singapore Company based in Anglo-Chinese School (Barker Road). In this capacity, he led over twenty volunteers in mentoring and guiding nearly 80 secondary school students weekly. Evan was also involved in the BB Share-a-Gift Project 2019 which aimed to spread Christmas cheer to over 43000 beneficiaries through the distribution of hampers. In recognition of his outstanding contributions to the BB and his sound character, Evan received the President’s Award from President Halimah Yacob in 2020.
