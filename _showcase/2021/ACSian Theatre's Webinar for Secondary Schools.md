## <center> ACSian Theatre's Webinar for Secondary Schools </center>

On 2nd July 2021, ACSian Theatre hosted a webinar for the Secondary 4 cohort of 2021, inviting students from all secondary schools to find out more about drama in ACJC.&nbsp;  

The purpose of the webinar was to give Secondary 4 theatre enthusiasts an insight into life as a member of ACSian Theatre.&nbsp;

We hoped that the sharing of personal stories and experiences&nbsp;would interest students and inspire them to join ACSian Theatre as they consider options for post-secondary education. This was a student-initiated outreach project led by the J1 Executive Committee of ACSian Theatre, innovatively adapting the sharing session for an online audience on Zoom.

The speaker line up included the Vice-Presidents (Artistic) of the J1 and J2 cohorts. They provided the attendees with a brief introduction to ACSian Theatre and gave them an overview of what experiences and opportunities are open to club members. The second set of speakers were two students from the 2021 J1 batch who entered the school through Direct School Admission (DSA) programme. They shared the process and integration into ACSian Theatre as DSA students. The teachers also gave an overview of the Drama Elective Programme (DEP), while a student from the 2021 J2 batch spoke of his experiences and how he benefited from being part of the DEP programme.

  

The highlights of this webinar were the insights from our alumni including special guest speakers, professional actor, Dennis Sofian and costume designer, Johanna Pan. Dennis discussed how ACSian Theatre and DEP equipped him with essential skills for his career as an actor. Showcasing the wonders of backstage crew work and design, Johanna Pan shared how ACSian Theatre and DEP set her off on her creative journey of learning the skills of a costume designer.&nbsp;

  

We would like to thank our alumni guest speakers, Dennis Sufian and Johanna Pan for taking the time to share their experiences. This webinar would not have been possible without the help and support of our teachers Mrs Geetha Creffield, Ms Michelle Wong, Ms Annabel Tan, Mr Tobias Teo and Mdm Baljeet Kaur. We would like to extend our gratitude to all the participants and the secondary school attendees for their sharing and questions during this enjoyable webinar.
