In addition to the Integrity, Tenacity and Passion they displayed in their academics, the Class of 2018 served as exemplars of these ACSian values on the playing field, in performances, in clubs and societies, in academics, and in their service to others. As a College, we cherish each and every one of them, and in line with our ethos, we would like to showcase a few students, ACSian paragons one and all, who were outstanding role models during their time at the college.

  

**Teh Ren Jie** performed outstandingly with 9 distinctions. An MOE-ASEAN scholar, Ren Jie has always been an academically driven student and he received the academic book prize for Chemistry at the end of JC One, and the Akbar Khan Award. His awards at the Science olympiads and general knowledge quizzes demonstrate his all-round capacity for excellence. Besides this, Ren Jie also displayed tremendous leadership capabilities as the Vice-President of the 42nd Students’ Council, while also being a dedicated debate mentor with the ACJC Oratorical and Debate Society. For his dedication to the college, Ren Jie was elected to the 2018 Principal’s Honour Roll. He is truly an outstanding ACSian.

Keliza herself performed well at the A Level Examinations. For her dedication and service to the college, Keliza was elected to the 2018 Principal’s Honour Roll and was valedictorian of her cohort. Keliza was also a recipient of the 2018 ECHA award.

  

**Tan Tze How Jasmond**, a National canoeist, has demonstrated his capacity as an all-rounder with outstanding academic results at the A Level Examinations. Jasmond was elected to the 2018 Principal’s Honour Roll and awarded the ACJC Sports Scholarship and the Peter Lim Scholarship for high performance in the under-18 category. He was also the 2018 Singapore Schools Sports Council’s Sports Boy as well as the canoeing captain of the National Junior Team.
