On the 27th and 28th of July, the ACJC Debate and Oratorical Society sent 4 teams to compete in Singapore Polytechnic Debate Open 2019, a debate competition hosted by the Singapore Polytechnic Debates. After 4 gruelling preliminary rounds and 3 knock-out rounds, one of the teams comprising Captain Ian Dylan Chai and Vice-Captain Shaun Alexander Wittberger emerged as the champions of the tournament, with Ian also bagging the prize for the best speaker of the finals round.

Throughout the tournament, the teams were challenged to debate thought provoking motions such as whether religious sites were a legitimate target of war, and whether feminists should reject media portraying women as subservient. We would all like express our most sincere gratitude to our coach, Samuel Myat San, for his invaluable guidance leading up to the tournament. All in all, the tournament was an extremely enriching and eye-opening experience, and we hope to carry our success forward into future tournaments
