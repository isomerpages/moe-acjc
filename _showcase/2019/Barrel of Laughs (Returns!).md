The cast of ‘Barrel of Laughs (Returns!)’ was ecstatic to present to our audience another fun-filled play. This year, the play used themes of money, bureaucracy, and family, to create witty and intellectual humour, for the audience’s entertainment. The story about a bank robbery gone wrong did not disappoint, bringing laughter and joy to the audience.

When the cast consisting of ACJC alumni (and some current students) started working on this play, it was tough and rigorous. However, with the guidance of our talented Director, Mrs Geetha Creffield, and the mentorship of the alumni, we managed to bring the play to life with great success.

The whole journey was not just enjoyable, but also enriching. The junior batches experienced the rigour of craft-making, while senior batches further explored the concept of mentorship. As a cast, everyone had the opportunity to learn more about creating and giving performances beyond the classroom, as well as boosting interpersonal skills. With strong camaraderie and commitment to their work, they were able to produce a thrilling and hilarious play for the audience.
