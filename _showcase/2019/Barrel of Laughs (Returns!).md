The cast of ‘Barrel of Laughs (Returns!)’ was ecstatic to present to our audience another fun-filled play. This year, the play used themes of money, bureaucracy, and family, to create witty and intellectual humour, for the audience’s entertainment. The story about a bank robbery gone wrong did not disappoint, bringing laughter and joy to the audience.
