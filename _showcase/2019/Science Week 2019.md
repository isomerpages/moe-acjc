## <center> Science Week 2019 </center> 

As part of the ACJC experience, our Science students were in for a treat during Science Week (8 to 12 April)!

Practicals for the week were replaced with fun activities, created and facilitated by our science tutors, and meant to stir up the joy of learning and deepen students’ appreciation of the various applications of science:

_JC1 & JC2 Chemistry – “Nylon-making” & “Gel beads”_

During lectures, our JC1 Physics and Chemistry students witnessed mind-boggling demonstrations by Prof Sow Chorng Haur, Head of the NUS Physics Department, and Dr Alex van Herk, Snr Scientist from the Institute of Chemical & Engineering Sciences (ICES). Our in-house expert on pharmaceutical sciences/biology tutor, Mr Jackson Koh, also gave a lecture to our JC1 Biology students on Drugs & Diseases.

  

To all our Science students who were part of Science Week 2019: we hope you had fun with the sciences, and remember the science behind the fun. :)
