## <center> National Poetry Competition 2019 </center>

The annual National Poetry Competition competition was held earlier this year. It was organised by Poetry Festival Singapore as a platform for aspiring poets and wordsmiths to better appreciate its intricacies in the growing local literary scene. The theme for the 5th edition of the competition is ‘Metamorphosis’: an abstract term worthy of contemplative thought which would then be translated into fine works of art. The theme prompts the writers to think of not only ideas of change or growth but also the ways in which experimentation with form can positively impact the poem’s aesthetic qualities.
