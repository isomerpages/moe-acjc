ACJC also participated in the Singapore Young Physicists’ Tournament 2018, and our college clinched the silver award. The team comprised Li Mengze (2MD6), Jaymi Mae Ching (2SA5), and Aloysius Tang (2SB3).

  

The Singapore Young Physicists’ Tournament (SYPT) team shares their reflection:

  

“Preparation for the SYPT was a tough, challenging but rewarding endeavour. We were stretched to our limits by the rigour of the experiments and the profound analysis mentioned in the journals we read. However, with guidance and help from our teachers, Mr Tay, Mr Koo and Mr Chang, we managed to pull through and even clinched the Silver award amongst the tough competition. We are immensely proud of our achievement but what was invaluable was the experience we gained from our months of preparation. We hope our juniors can continue this legacy and do well in the competition.”
