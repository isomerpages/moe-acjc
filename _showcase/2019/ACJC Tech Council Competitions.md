## <center> ACJC Tech Council Competitions </center>

ACJC's Tech Council participated in the Canadian Computing Competition (CCC) on 21 February 19 and the National Olympiad in Informatics (NOI) on 23 March 19. We are proud to announce that 3 of our students obtained Certificates of Distinction in CCC and 1 of our student obtained a Bronze Medal in the NOI.

These are very commendable achievements considering our members had no programming experience prior to joining Tech Council. It is a testament to the integrity, tenacity and passion they've showed as programmers, and as ACSians.

The Tech Council is grateful for the support and encouragement from the school leaders, teachers, parents and friends. May Tech Council continue to promote the craft of computing and responsible use of technology.

_To God be the Glory! The Best is Yet to Be!_
