Having gone through intensive preparation for the festival, our members have developed both in musicianship and character under the baton of our beloved conductor, Mr Alvin Seville. The ACJC Concert Band is also immensely grateful to our school leaders, teachers, families and friends for their constant support and encouragement. We would also like to give thanks to God for bestowing upon us the gift of music and music-making, allowing the ACJC Concert Band to come thus far in our achievements and accolades.

It is our utmost hope that the Concert Band will continue to strive for excellence, leaving a legacy of music-making of the highest calibre.

_To God Be The Glory, The Best Is Yet To Be!_
