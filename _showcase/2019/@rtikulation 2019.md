On 29 July 2019, the J1 and J2 Music Elective Programme (MEP) batches held our annual recital, @rtikulation, at the Esplanade Recital Studio. It was truly an enriching experience for all of us - not only being able to perform at one of the most well-known performance venues in Singapore, but also developing a high level of musicianship and friendship with one another through the months of hard work and practice put in prior to the concert. The recital allowed us to present a wide variety of performances, ranging from solo piano, string and wind instruments to chamber pieces of varying instrumentation. The recital also featured the premiere of A Day at the Prata Place, a piece composed by our very own alumni MEP student, Toh Yan Ee.

As the concert began, we all awaited our turn restlessly backstage, but still managed to catch snippets of our friendsâ€™ performances through the speakers in the dressing room. Everyone was indeed extremely supportive of one another regardless of batch as each time the performers finished their item and returned to the dressing room, they were greeted with applause and cheers from their peers. The recital closed with the presentation of our tokens of appreciation to our teachers, Mrs Lovy Tan and Ms Chow Pei Yan, as a way for us to show our gratitude for their hard work and guidance throughout the months of preparation leading up to the recital.

 The recital also gave us the opportunity to present some of our students with scholarships sponsored by Mr Clifton Tan. Mrs Valarie Wilson, the Director of the Arts Education, Student Development Curriculum Division, Ministry of Education, was our Guest of Honour for the evening and presented the awards to the students. Chan Shee Ann, Shannon and Amanda Gnai Song Hui had the privilege of receiving the Clifton Tan Music Elective Programme Scholarships for J1 and J2 respectively, while Amanda also had the honour of receiving the Clifton Tan Young Performer Award, and Lee Qing had the privilege of receiving the Clifton Tan Young Composer Award.

@rtikulation 2019 was a memorable experience for all, and was truly one to be treasured.
