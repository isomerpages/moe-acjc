“The A\*STAR science award provides a good opportunity for me to experience what it is like to carry out real research work as I am considering doing research as a future career. In addition, it would enable me to learn content beyond the school syllabus, making it a very enriching experience. I look forward to work on a project alongside with an A\*STAR researcher. This golden opportunity does not come easy and I want to make full use of it as much as possible.”
