## <center> LKCMed Anatomy Challenge </center> 

The LKCMedicine Anatomy Challenge 2019 is organised by the NTU Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine, and this year, the event drew about 240 students, making up about 60 teams from the polytechnic biomedical schools, junior colleges and IP schools.

12 students represented ACJC in this Quiz; intrinsically interested in Neuroanatomy, they worked hard on covering as much ground as they could on this complex discipline. We were grateful to have our alumni, Mr Tan En Jie (Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine, NTU) and Mr Steven Liu (Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, NUS) to support the teams in their preparation. Despite the daunting complexity of the content, they demonstrated ACSian tenacity in striving to master it. The quiz was also no easy feat and even medical students were stumped by some of the questions. We congratulate all our participants for their good work and grit!
