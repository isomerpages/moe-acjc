## <center> LKCMed Anatomy Challenge </center> 

The LKCMedicine Anatomy Challenge 2019 is organised by the NTU Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine, and this year, the event drew about 240 students, making up about 60 teams from the polytechnic biomedical schools, junior colleges and IP schools.

12 students represented ACJC in this Quiz; intrinsically interested in Neuroanatomy, they worked hard on covering as much ground as they could on this complex discipline. We were grateful to have our alumni, Mr Tan En Jie (Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine, NTU) and Mr Steven Liu (Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, NUS) to support the teams in their preparation. Despite the daunting complexity of the content, they demonstrated ACSian tenacity in striving to master it. The quiz was also no easy feat and even medical students were stumped by some of the questions. We congratulate all our participants for their good work and grit!

Myra & Zachary share their reflections on the journey:

  

_"Going into this challenge, i didn't think that it would be so rich in information, including clinical-based situations, and everything you would learn at a university level. This challenge helped open my eyes to the realm of and i have benefitted immensely through the challenge, the sessions we had with the alumni, as well as the various exhibitions we were able to attend on the day itself. It was such an enriching experience and i wouldn't exchange it for anything else." - Myra_

  

_"LKCAnatomy Challenge 2019 was one of the most memorable events I have attended, thanks to the talented students of LKC School of Medicine who organised this. This event was not only a competition to test our knowledge of the human body, but also comprised a workshop on various intriguing ideas and insights with regard to the medical field. This challenge has allowed me to understand many things about human physiology & anatomy, all while having a tremendous amount of fun. This event has undoubtedly heightened my interest for medicine and I would highly recommend this to those with similar interests." - Zachary_

  

We hope their juniors will be inspired to take on this experience!
