## <center> Black &amp; White </center>

It was a spectacular night of musical acts, with 7 bands comprising students and alumni who took to the stage to charm the audience with their musical talent. The performances ranged from Indie Rock to Ballads, and there was even an acapella group who serenaded everyone with a medley of songs. The Centre of Performing Arts was also graced with the presence of notable alumni, including Ethel Yap, John Cheah, Joy Yong, Nathan Hartono, and The Sam Willows, who shared their ACJC experiences after giving a marvelous performance that had the audience leaping out of their seats!

With ACSian Theatre as the artistic producer and alumnus Timothy Chang as the music programmer, the Arts Council is honored to have brought Black &amp; White back for ACJCâ€™s performers to showcase their talents, and provide a platform for new bands to pursue their passions. We would like to thank everyone for their support and we hope it was a wonderful evening for all!
