The Singapore Amazing Flying Machine Competition was held in March 2019. Organised by the DSO National Laboratories and the Science Centre Singapore, it was also supported by MINDEF.

ACJC collaborated with Temasek Junior College &amp; the Singapore Institute of Technology on the project, “Investigation and Optimisation of Aerodynamic Performance of Biomimetic Gliders for Future Transportation”. Their task for the competition was to design and build a small remote-controlled fixed-wing air platform to navigate an obstacle course.

We are pleased to announce that the team came in 3rd in the category on the Theory of Flight!

Congratulations to the team!
