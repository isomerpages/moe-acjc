From 12th to 30th April, the ACJC Softball Team competed in the National A Divisions. We are proud to announce that we have emerged as champions for the third successive year!

This season would not have been victorious without hard work from the team and all our supporters. Without the patient guidance of our coach, Coach Elaine and the constant encouragement from our teachers-in-charge, Ms Liew and Mrs Tan, we would not have been able to fight our way to championship.

We are also proud to have been featured in a Straits Times article.

The ACJC Softball Team is extremely grateful for the support and motivation provided by everyone throughout the intensive training leading up to and during our season, especially from our school leaders, parents, teachers and friends. We would also like to thank God for watching over us and ensuring our safety throughout our training and competitions.

We hope that the Softball team will continue to excel and strive to continue this tradition of excellence.

_To God be the Glory, The Best is Yet to Be!_
