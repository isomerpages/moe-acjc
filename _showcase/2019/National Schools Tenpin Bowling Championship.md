We would like to give a huge shout out to our teachers Mr Koo, Mdm Jamilah, Ms Marian and Mdm Palo for their dedication and hard work, and our coach Uncle Billy for training us diligently to prepare us for our competition and Mr Toh for thinking of us. Last but certainly not least, big thanks to the photographic society, the councillors, the supporters, Ms Annalisa who prayed with us and Mrs Choo who came down to support us for the finals.
