## <center> ACJC Open House 2019 </center>

Anglo-Chinese Junior College held our Open House for 2019 from 12-5pm on Wednesday the 9th of January, with the theme "Imagine the Possibilities". With no other junior colleges holding their open houses on the same day we were pleased to welcome a record-setting crowd of 2500 or more to the College. Present were graduating students from the Methodist family of schools, as well as a plethora of others. Parents of prospective students, and even current Secondary Four students attended too.

Our Principal, Dr Shirleen Chee, opened the event with a short pep talk, followed by a word of prayer. Dr Chee reminded the College of this year’s initiative to lead from the inside out- all members of the ACJC family were exhorted to lead in their own way through putting the College’s best foot forward. The happy throngs that swarmed the campus seemed to be a clear testament to the entire College putting these words into action.
