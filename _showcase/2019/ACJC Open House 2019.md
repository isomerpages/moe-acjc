Anglo-Chinese Junior College held our Open House for 2019 from 12-5pm on Wednesday the 9th of January, with the theme "Imagine the Possibilities". With no other junior colleges holding their open houses on the same day we were pleased to welcome a record-setting crowd of 2500 or more to the College. Present were graduating students from the Methodist family of schools, as well as a plethora of others. Parents of prospective students, and even current Secondary Four students attended too.
