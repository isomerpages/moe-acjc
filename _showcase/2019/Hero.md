## <center> Hero </center>

On the 6 and 7 of August, ACSian Theatre’s J1 batch of 2019 staged our first club production: Hero. The play was adapted from the script of the 2002 wuxia movie Hero directed by Zhang Yimou, based on the story of Jing Ke’s assassination attempt on the king of Qin in 227 BC. A tale of deception and sacrifice, this show encourages its audience to ponder what they are willing to do, or to give up, for the greater good.

  

An exciting action-filled ensemble piece, Hero centres around Nameless, a Qin prefect, as he tells the story of three assassinations to the king. Different versions of the story are told - each conveyed with a colour shift in the stage lighting - finally ending with the true story. Using an array of weapons such as swords, daggers and poles, the actors performed stunning martial arts sequences. Accompanied with live music and costumes reflective of the time period, this performance amazed its audience on all fronts.

The production of this show would not have been possible without our teachers, Mrs Geetha Creffield, Ms Michelle Wong, Mdm Baljeet Kaur, Ms Low Tze Hui and Mr Tobias Teo, our martial arts coach Randell Siow, and our alumni directors, Timothy and Jit. Last but not least, we would also like to extend our gratitude to our audience for their support.
