The College is proud to announce that the Class of 2018 have achieved excellent results, a true testament to their hard work, dedication, and determination.Of the subjects offered at the H2 level, all achieved percentage passes above the national average, with many gaining distinctions for more than half their cohorts. Nearly all subjects offered at H1 level including Project Work, had percentage passes above national average, with many gaining distinctions for more than half their cohorts.

  

During their 2 years at ACJC, the members of the Class of 2018 have distinguished themselves on the playing field, in performances, in clubs and societies, in academics, and in their service to others. The College gives thanks for each and every one of them. We will be sharing some of their stories in an upcoming article.

  

The College would like to thank all who have played a part in the success of the Class of 2018: our dedicated staff, the ever-supportive parents of the Class of 2018, and the wider ACS and Methodist family.

  

Most of all, we give thanks to God for His infinite goodness.

  

To God be the Glory! The Best is Yet to Be!
