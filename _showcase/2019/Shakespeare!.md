On the 4th, 5th and 6th of April, ACSian Theatre presented ‘Shakespeare!’, a romantic rock musical comedy.

The colourful story follows a young William Shakespeare as he struggles to write his play “Romeo and Juliet”, whilst pursuing a forbidden romance with Viola de Lesseps. Aided by his friend Christopher Marlowe, he has run ins with debtors, rivals, and even the Queen of England, eventually earning her patronage. The audience was presented with an adventure filled with love, humour, heartbreak, dance, self-composed music and live instrumentation; showing the versatility of ACSian Theatre’s talented cast.

Putting up a spectacular show, the cast poured their hearts out breathing new life into the characters, most of which were romanticised versions of historical figures. The alumni cast, in addition to performing, adapted famous sonnets into song for the show as they rehearsed vigorously with the cast. Behind the scenes, costumers and crew created beautiful and intricate costumes and props, alluding to the Renaissance era in which the play is set in. All the hard work from everyone allowed our audience to be captivated by this spectacular performance onstage!
