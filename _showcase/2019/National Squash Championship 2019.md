## <center> National Squash Championship 2019 </center>

Both the boys and girls of ACJC Squash competed in the National A Division Squash Championships 2019, and our months of training and hard work have paid off. The boys have emerged in 4th place and the girls achieved a 1st runners-up position.

We would like to extend our gratitude to our teachers-in-charge, who guided and supported us throughout the entire season. A huge thank you as well to Coach Matthew, for imparting to us valuable skills and advice in the court. We are also extremely grateful for the encouragement from our friends, the student councilors, and the Photographic Society. The greatest thanks be to God our living hope, without whom all of this would not be possible.

_To God be the Glory, the Best is Yet to Be!_
