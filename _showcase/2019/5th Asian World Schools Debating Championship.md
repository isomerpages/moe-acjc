## <center> 5th Asian World Schools Debating Championship </center>

The members of the ACJC Debate and Oratorical society participated in the 5th Asian World Schools Debating Championships 2019 from 15th to 20th July in Bangkok, Thailand and had the opportunity to hone our debating skills amidst grueling rounds against several opponents from the 62 teams that participated across the world.

The opportunity to be drawn against world famous national teams and learn from their structure, style and arguments was indeed an inspiring one that fueled our quest to become better debaters as we realized that there were so many more techniques to learn and master.

The motions we debated explored conflicts amongst countries as well as the importance of various different actors and media forms. This allowed us to see the world in a different light. We also obtained insights from different adjudicators which enabled us to re-evaluate our logical reasoning and persuasiveness.

The trip was a cultural exchange as well as we got to make friends with people from other countries such as through our friendly spars with Team Vietnam at the hotel. Overall, the debaters forged several memorable experiences and rediscovered the art of debating through this eventful trip. We would like to thank coach Sam for his relentless guidance and the teachers Ms Yvonne Cheah, Mrs Singh and Mrs Geetha Creffield for their support and encouragement.
