## <center> Nanyang Research Programme 2019 </center>

In 2018, eight ACJC students were selected for the Nanyang Research Programme (NRP), an annual research outreach programme organised by Nanyang Technological University (NTU). Their research topics ranged from Mathematical and Natural Sciences to Social Sciences. After one year of rigorous research, the students successfully completed their projects under the mentorship of their NTU professors and presented their projects at the NRP Symposium. We are proud to announce that our ACSians did extremely well, all winning awards for their projects.
