The Science and Mathematics departments set aside a week in Term 2 annually for students to explore real-life applications in the relevant scientific and mathematical fields and spark their joy in learning in the sciences and mathematics. Science and Mathematics Week 2023 was held from 10th – 14th April.

For the special Science Week practicals, Biology students cultured swab samples from various locations in ACJC to discover the number and variety of bacterial colonies after 1 – 2 days of incubation. In addition, they investigated the antibacterial effects of garlic, onion and ginger as well as their choice of hand sanitiser on the growth of E. coli.

JC1 Chemistry students analysed phosphoric acid in coke using a pH sensor that is wirelessly connected to an application in their devices to obtain a pH curve to determine the concentration of phosphoric acid present. Our JC2 Chemistry students explored interesting reactions involving Group 2 and Group 17 elements.

JC1 Physics students investigated the gravitational acceleration through the projectile motion of an object using the Tracker software and JC2 students found their inner child through the construction of anti-gravity structures and homopolar motor.

In addition, there were special guest lecturers on biological topics that are beyond the A Level syllabus. Dr Ying Chang, an Assistant Professor from the NUS Department of Biological Sciences, shared about the endophytic fungi living within the tissues of mangrove plants, and the different types of relationships of fungi with their hosts. Dr Chii Jou Chan, an Assistant Professor from the Mechanobiology Institute of NUS, shared about the mechanical forces and fluid pressures in shaping mammalian ovary and embryo development.

The Mathematics Department organised a Learning Journey to the Urban Redevelopment Authority. Through a guided tour of the Singapore City Gallery and a sharing session by a URA officer, students learnt about the applications of mathematics and statistics to urban planning, and discover the inter-connectedness of all the departments within URA in creating a quality living environment for all of us.

Through these special practicals, guest lectures and learning journey, we hope our students found the learning enriching and fun. We look forward to next year’s Science and Mathematics Week!
