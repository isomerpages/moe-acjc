On June 11, ACSian Theatre finally returned to contribute to the annual Assisi Fun Day, held at Saint Joseph's Institution International School (SJII) after a 3-year long pandemic hiatus. The (VIA) Face-Painting booth was planned for and run to raise funds for patients with terminal illnesses in Assisi Hospice, providing a platform for students to give back to the community. This opportunity was warmly welcomed as were able to use our theatre-based skills of makeup and costuming to bring cheer and colour to the event.

It was a heart-warming time of service, with customers leaving with bright smiles and vibrantly painted faces. Throughout the day, we received a steady stream of requests from young children who wanted to be painted as their favourite characters and adults who wanted to join in on the fun. Specially painted icons also helped to drum up sales for other booth vendors. This VIA gave us the meaningful opportunity to hone our artistic skills and create fond memories with each other while ultimately working towards the good of the community. 
	
This experience showed us the value of patience, adaptability and communication and gifted us the opportunity to forge closer connections with each other as batchmates. We received kind words of appreciation from the organisers, and Guest-of-Honour Ms Ho Ching. From this VIA experience, we learned about the spirit of service from the numerous volunteers for this event and the dedicated staff of Assisi Hospice. Overall, it was a splendid experience. Our club members expressed great pleasure in being involved and we are looking forward to being invited back to Assisi Fun Day next year!
