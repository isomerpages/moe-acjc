*“Dance is like love! Follow your inner beat”*

On 18 April 2023, ACSian Theatre presented their dance performance, titled “Global Bollywood”, at the Indian Dance category of the Singapore Youth Festival (SYF), achieving a Certificate of Distinction.

Featuring a medley of familiar Bollywood tunes and modern hits, the performance combined traditional Indian dance, drawing heavily from Bhangra, and contemporary dance to create an energetic and vibrant piece that captivated audiences and judges alike.

Though the ensemble entered with little to no experience with the art form, they took up the challenge with gusto and open minds. After months of tireless training, beyond just attaining the highest possible achievement at the SYF, the entire cast gained a deep respect and appreciation for the intricacies of Indian dance and its cultural value.

This meaningful experience would not have been possible without the constant, enthusiastic support of our teachers, alumni and peers, who have cheered us on every step of the way. Our deepest, most sincere gratitude goes out to our teachers – Mrs Geetha Creffield, Ms Michelle Wong, Ms Annabel Tan, Mr Tobias Teo and Mdm Baljeet Kaur – for their invaluable patience and encouragement. Our warmest thank you goes to our choreographer, Mr Gerard Sebastian Raj, whose passionate, enlightening guidance allowed us to bring the explosive spirit of Bollywood to life on the SYF stage.

To God Be The Glory, 
The Best Is Yet To Be!
