As Billy Joel himself once said, “Music in itself is healing. It’s an explosion of expression of humanity. It’s something we are all touched by. No matter what culture we’re from, everyone loves music.”. And it is none other than this quote that perfectly encapsulates 2023’s Black &amp; White.

This spectacular night was filled with seven show-stopping musical acts by alumni and student bands. Our audience had the time of their lives grooving to 80’s Rock-and-Roll hits, smashing Renaissance tunes and even unforgettable modern Pop and Indie medleys. This electrifying line-up of immensely talented performers effortlessly brought this concert back to a live audience after its three-year pandemic hiatus – with a huge, melodious, bang!

Our phenomenal alumni bands, First Take, Cinquecento, Wanderlust and The Sea Jellies absolutely dazzled the audience with their musical renditions and original songs. Our very own JC2 band, Safety Hazard, and the one and only ACJC Teachers’ Band, The Post Pandemic Parachutes, captured audiences’ hearts with their lyrical storytelling. To top it all off, the Faith Centre for Performing Arts was graced by the presence of notable ACS alumnus and international musician, Benjamin Kheng, who had the audience leaping out of their seats with his breath-taking performance!

ACJC’s Arts Council is honoured and elated to have brought back Black &amp; White, to provide a platform for our ACS family to express their passion for music and inspire a whole new generation of artistic talents. ACSian Theatre was the event’s artistic producer, with Head of Department (HOD) of the Arts, Mrs Geetha Creffield, and alumnus, Victoria Lam, as co-organisers and musical directors for this night of bands. We would like to extend a huge thank you for the amazing support to our technical and backstage crew, school leaders, teachers, alumni, current students, and fellow music lovers! We hope to see you at the next Black &amp; White! 

To God be the Glory, The Best is Yet to Be!
