The Science and Mathematics Council successfully concluded the 44th C. B. Paul Science Quiz 2023 during the Science and Mathematics Week. This quiz is named after Reverend Charles Blackshear Paul, who was a teacher at ACS between 1912 to 1950.

Our Guest-of-Honour for the event was Professor Bernard Tan Tiong Gie, Emeritus Professor at the Department of Physics, NUS. Our Special Guest was Associate Professor Tan Tin Wee, Chief Executive of the National Supercomputing Centre.

The C. B. Paul Science Quiz consists of questions set by our very own students here in ACJC, which are crafted to be both challenging and intriguing to the participants. The questions are then vetted by our Science and Mathematics departments, as well as by the judges who kindly volunteered their time to advance scientific education and inspire the next generation of scientists. We are thankful to the following judges:

1.	Assistant Professor Tan Yong Zi (Biology)
2.	Associate Professor Soo Han Sen (Chemistry)
3.	Associate Professor Aaron Tan (Computer Science)
4.	Associate Professor Ng Keng Meng (Mathematics)
5.	Dr. Abel Yang (Physics)

This year, the Quiz was held in a hybrid manner. The Preliminary Round was conducted over ClassMarker in the participants’ schools with teacher invigilation and monitoring by the Organising Committee over Zoom on 29 March. Thereafter, the finalist teams and award winners were invited to ACJC to attend the Final Round in-person on 12 April. The award winners had a chance to win prizes in the Audience Round using an online buzzer system! The finalist teams were from Crescent Girls’ School, Fuhua Secondary School, Hwa Chong Institution and NUS High School of Math and Science.

We celebrate the participants’ achievements and trust that they will continue to deepen their passion for Science and Mathematics.
