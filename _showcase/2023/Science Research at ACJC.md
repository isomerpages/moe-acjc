ACJC sent 3 teams comprising 15 students to participate in The Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine Anatomy Challenge 2023. In spite of the challenging theme, “Head and Neck”,
our representatives trained with supportive alumni and clinched individual distinction and merit awards.

At the NUS Chemical Engineering Challenge, our 2 teams comprising of a total of 8 students tackled topics such as Principle of Mass and Energy Balance, Thermodynamics and Diffusion, where one of our teams was awarded 2nd runner up.

For the Singapore Science and Engineering Fair (SSEF) 2023 organised by MOE, A*STAR and the Science Centre Singapore, ACJC submitted 11 projects and 2 projects received the Merit award.
 
In addition, ACJC participated in the 24th International Elementz Fair 2023, organised by ASRJC where 5 projects were submitted and received multiple awards:

**Bronze Award and Special Award from the Singapore Association for the Advancement of Science Poster Award for Science Communication (SSEF): **

Kenneth Hubert Suhardjo (2SC2)
