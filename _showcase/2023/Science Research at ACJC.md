ACJC sent 3 teams comprising 15 students to participate in The Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine Anatomy Challenge 2023. In spite of the challenging theme, “Head and Neck”,
our representatives trained with supportive alumni and clinched individual distinction and merit awards.

At the NUS Chemical Engineering Challenge, our 2 teams comprising of a total of 8 students tackled topics such as Principle of Mass and Energy Balance, Thermodynamics and Diffusion, where one of our teams was awarded 2nd runner up.

For the Singapore Science and Engineering Fair (SSEF) 2023 organised by MOE, ASTAR and the Science Centre Singapore, ACJC submitted 11 projects and 2 projects received the Merit award.
 
In addition, ACJC participated in the 24th International Elementz Fair 2023, organised by ASRJC where 5 projects were submitted and received multiple awards.

Lastly, we congratulate our NTU Nanyang Research Programme representative for her award winning presentation titled “Emission of rare earth ions by energy transfer from ZnO nanocrystals embedded in silicondioxide film”.
