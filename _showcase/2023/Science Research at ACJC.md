The Singapore Science and Engineering Fair (SSEF) 2023 is a national competition organised by the Ministry of Education (MOE), the Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A\*STAR) and the Science Centre Singapore for students to showcase their passion in research and communicate their findings to experts from the industry. The SSEF Final Judging Round was held in Singapore Science Centre on 8th March, in which our student finalist teams presented their posters.

This year, our school submitted 11 projects for the SSEF 2023, of which 7 were shortlisted for the Final Judging Round.

Our students also participated in the 24th International Elementz Fair (IEF) 2023, which was organised by Anderson Serangoon Junior College. 5 projects were submitted, of which, 4 were shortlisted for the Final Judging Round conducted on 18th April. The finalists presented their project findings via Zoom, and answered questions posed by the expert judges.

We are pleased to announce our achievements.

**Bronze Award and Special Award from the Singapore Association for the Advancement of Science Poster Award for Science Communication (SSEF):**

Kenneth Hubert Suhardjo (2SC2)

“Anti Inflammatory Effects of Mushroom Extract on Gut Health in the Zebrafish Model”

**Merit Award (SSEF) and Bronze Award (IEF):**

Shem Koh (2SA1) and John Tang (2SA1)

(2)&nbsp;&nbsp; Quek El Lynn (2SC2), Coen Tan (2SC1) and Luke Yoong (2SA1)

“Comparative effects of using frases and other fertilisers on plant growth and soil pH”

Nguyen Thanh Tin (2SA6) reflected on his research journey:

“I learnt valuable skills such as Adobe AutoCAD, 3D printing, and PID control of drones. Within a short time, I learnt to critically delegate tasks and kept track of team performance, while presenting literature findings and secondary experimental results to researchers in I2R. Indeed, the research was an enriching one that further prepared me for my future pursuit in Aerospace Engineering.”

Lastly, we would also like to congratulate our Nanyang Research Programme student, Leanne Chua from 2SB5 for receiving the Bronze Award for her NTU NRP presentation titled “Emission of rare earth ions by energy transfer from ZnO nanocrystals embedded in silicon dioxide film”.
