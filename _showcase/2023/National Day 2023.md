Our Guest of Honour, Mr Justin Ang, alumnus of the Class of 1998 and Assistant Chief Executive of IMDA shared how his time in ACJC shaped his character and influenced him over the cours eof an illustrious career in the private and public sectors. Sharing from the book of Esther, he exhorted our students to know their identity and stand up for what is right.

We were also treated to lively performances by ACSian Theatre and the ACJC Choir, and our CCA groups shared their heartfelt wishes for Singapore through a video. The Celebrations ended with a bang as the combined Teachers &amp; Students Band brought the house down with a medley of well-loved NDP songs, ending with a rousing rendition of the ACS Anthem.

*To God Be The Glory, The Best Is Yet To Be!*
