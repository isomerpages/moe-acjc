On September 9, ACSian Theatre presented our dance performance titled “Welcome to Singapore”, at the Sri Srivaran Perumal Temple as part of Project SMILE. This dance was our contribution to support Project SMILE's mission of uplifting underprivileged women and improving their quality of life. We enthusiastically took this opportunity to utilise our performance abilities to spread joy and bring smiles to the faces of many.

Participating in this Values in Action (VIA) project was truly enlightening since it marked our inaugural performance for such a cause. It revealed to us the immense delight and happiness that dance can bring to individuals. Despite not being present for the entire duration of the event, we received numerous compliments and expressions of gratitude from those attending the event, which greatly brightened our spirits. This VIA experience emphasised the significance of community service, showcasing the impact we can achieve by dedicating our time to assist our community.

This experience also imparted a valuable lesson in line with our choreographer's advice, “It is not about the dancer, it is about the dance.” Dance is an immediate and expressive means of communication, and our challenge was to remain adaptable and resilient throughout the rehearsal process in order to give our best for the audience. We were then extremely pleased to receive words of appreciation from the organisers and those who were there to support Project SMILE’s cause. Our club members thoroughly enjoyed this experience and are deeply appreciative of the chance to perform and contribute to the community. We are looking forward to being invited back to Project SMILE next year!
