We would like to thank our ACJC alumni trainers who are current Year 1 Medicine students, Zachary Tan and Timothy Teo from the Class of 2021 as well as Zuriel Khoo from the Class of 2019, for taking time out of their busy schedules to help their juniors with anatomical concepts.

To God Be The Glory, The Best Is Yet To Be!
