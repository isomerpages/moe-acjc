On the 30th, 31st of March and 1st of April, ACSian Theatre returned to the Faith Centre for Performing Arts stage with one of Shakespeare’s most iconic comedies, As You Like It! 

The play tells the story of a young upstart, Orlando, who is exiled by the Duke and fearful of his murderous brother. Having fallen in love with the Duke’s similarly exiled niece, Rosalind, they separately flee to seek safety in Arden. Rosalind disguises herself as a man and is accompanied by her loyal cousin, Celia. Clad in suave denim jackets and endearing floral dresses, neon lights flicker on and we are transported to the world of 1950s rock ’n’ roll. Laughter, cheers and exclamations of awe filled the air over the three nights, as energetic dance numbers, on-stage buffoonery and hilarious love entanglements kept the audience on the edge of their seats! 

In preparation for this show, the cast tenaciously honed their performance craft and the backstage and costuming crew worked tirelessly to ensure all costume and set elements were in tip-top condition. As such, we would like to extend our deepest gratitude to our teachers, Mrs Geetha Creffield, Ms Michelle Wong, Ms Annabel Tan, Mdm Baljeet Kaur and Mr Tobias Teo for their unwavering support, patient guidance and for being there with us in every step of bringing this production to life! We would also like to convey a special thanks to our choreographer, Dr Filomar Cortezano, for his vibrant artistic vision, steady mentoring and precision in developing our skills as well-rounded performers. Last, but definitely not least, ACSian Theatre is grateful for the constant encouragement from our school leaders, teachers, alumni, friends and family.

To say that As You Like It was a success would be an understatement. It was the pinnacle of the dynamic rigour displayed by each and every cast and crew member and the diligent mentoring of teachers and instructors. As You Like It will continue to serve as a heartening example of how effective storytelling and theatre-making can be achieved through camaraderie, collaboration and commitment. 

“And this our life, exempt from public haunt, 
Finds tongues in trees, books in the running brooks,
Sermons in stones, and good in everything.”

To God be the Glory, The Best is Yet to Be!
