Two teams comprising a total of 8 students took part in the Chem-E Challenge 2023. The Chem-E challenge is organised by the NUS Chemical Engineering Student Society, covering topics such as Principle of Mass and Energy Balance, Thermodynamics and Diffusion. Our teams were challenged with 2 supervised laboratory activities in the NUS Labs, and took part in a group quiz to test their understanding of Chemical Engineering.
