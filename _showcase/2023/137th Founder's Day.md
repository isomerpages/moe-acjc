ACJC celebrated the ACS Founder’s Day on 1st March 2023. This was an especially memorable Founder’s Day as it was the first full-scale Founder’s Day Service since 2019. 

  

As always, Founder’s Day is not just about looking back on the storied history God has granted us but celebrating the possibilities that are yet to be. The Academic Awards were a reminder of this, showcasing the diverse talents of the classes of 2021 and 2023. The College was honoured to have Mr Chew Kwee San, Executive Director of the Tecity Group to grace the event as Guest of Honour. Mr Chew spoke engagingly about his memories at ACJC and the values he has carried forward with him. The award ceremony was, as always, a roll call of ACSian excellence, made more poignant by the fact that the Class of 2021 were returning to College for the first time in two years, and to the School Hall which they had not been able to use during their time in College due to the restrictions of the Covid-19 Pandemic.

  

 In conjunction with Founder’s Day 2023, ACJC was also pleased to rededicate our Heritage Gallery, showcasing our vibrant heritage, dating back to the very first plans for a college section of the Anglo-Chinese School in the late 19th century, to the fruition of this vision, through God’s grace, in 1978 and to the divinely guided growth that we have been blessed with since. Present were many former School Leaders and distinguished alumni of the ACS Family. 

  

Truly we can say that God’s grace has carried us from the struggles of the past, through the storms of the present and we can look to the future in the sure and certain knowledge that The Best is Yet to Be!
