For the first time in three years, Barrel of Laughs has made a comeback. Consisting of a collection of playlets that had the audience roaring with laughter and left in stitches, this show was directed by Syed Jalal Ahmed Gilani, President of ACSian Theatre (2022). From stage renditions of cult-classic sitcoms such as _Fawlty Towers_ to comic duologues, the cast provided a wide range of entertainment for the audiences of both nights.

The rehearsals were a wonderful opportunity for the alumni of various batches to work together, not only with one another, but with select members of the current ACSian Theatre JC2 batch of 2023. The laughter and cheer in addition to the hard work put in by all those involved made the show a night to remember.

This show was only made possible thanks to the efforts of the cast and crew. We would also like to thank the teachers, Mrs Geetha Creffield, Ms Michelle Wong, Mdm Baljeet Kaur, Mr Tobias Teo and Ms Annabel Tan for their unconditional and constant support throughout the process. We would also like to give special thanks to our returning alumni for their commitment in giving back to the community by demonstrating the passion for the dramatic arts on the stage of our school’s Faith Centre for Performing Arts.

ACSian Theatre aims to continue spreading laughter and joy in 2023. We hope to have many more audiences enjoy the new and exciting performances in ACSian Theatre’s performing arts season this year!

To God be the Glory, the Best is Yet to Be!
