## <center> A Midsummer Night's Dream</center>

ACSian Theatre came back to the main stage of the Faith Centre for Performing Arts with a bang to present William Shakespeare’s A Midsummer Night’s Dream. On the 7th, 8th and 9th of April, the cast and crew were thrilled to present one of Shakespeare’s most popular and famous comedies, with this prose adaptation set in the roaring 20’s.

The worlds of mortals and fairies collide when Athenian lovers, Lysander, Demetrius, Hermia, and Helena, find themselves muddled in love and become lost in a forest outside of Athens. The forest is the domain of the magical world of Oberon and Titania, the Fairy King and Queen, along with Puck, the mischievous fairy who loves to play tricks on the humans. Meanwhile, rough Athenian workmen are rehearsing for a play to be performed for King Theseus’ wedding celebrations. Spells, wonder and fairy-delights kept the audience on the edge of their seats, with fast-paced comedy, heartfelt romance and captivating dance sequences!&nbsp;

The rehearsals were a fun-filled and meaningful learning process for more experienced actors and first-timers who shared the stage together in the spirit of collaborative learning and a shared love of theatre. With each roar of laughter and each gasp of amazement, it became clear that the hard work and effort put in by the cast, crew, and all other pivotal members of the ACSian Theatre family translated to excellence on the stage.

Give me your hands if we be friends/ And Robin shall restore amends!

Along the way, the cast and crew learnt about the importance of teamwork and perseverance, without which, the show would not have been a success. We would like to thank our teachers, Mrs Geetha Creffield, Ms Michelle Wong, Mdm Baljeet Kaur, Mr Tobias Teo, Ms Annabel Tan and Mr Jeremy Wong, who each played an instrumental role in bringing this production to life. Additionally, we extend our deepest gratitude to our choreographer, Dr Filomar Cortezano, for his creative vision and meticulous care and detail in shaping us as all-rounded performers.&nbsp;

  

ACSian Theatre is also blessed to have the unwavering support of our school leaders, teachers, parents and alumni, to whom we will always owe our thanks. The tenacity displayed by everyone involved in the process has allowed this production to blossom to its fullest potential, making it all worthwhile.

  

A Midsummer Night’s Dream by ACSian Theatre was living proof that even in the most difficult of times, resilience, faith and trust in those who continue to guide and support us keeps the traditions of theatre and storytelling alive…all while having a good laugh along the way!&nbsp;

  

To God be the Glory, The Best is Yet to Be!
