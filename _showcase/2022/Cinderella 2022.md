ACSian Theatre’s Cinderella

_“I never thought I could go...Everyone...Even my father...They thought I was a princess…”_

On 25 and 26 November 2022, ACSian Theatre took to the stage at the Faith Centre for Performing Arts for the final time this year to present&nbsp;_Cinderella_. In an adaptation of the timeless fairy tale, the titular heroine is saved from a life of gruelling kitchen work through fairy magic, which transforms her into a beautiful princess for the nightly Royal Ball. However, the “charming” Prince Rufus turns out to be entitled and possessive, driving her back to the kitchens to find true love.

  

We were truly honoured to receive such great reception from the audience for both nights. The play’s slapstick and farce was greeted with thunderous laughter, its twists and turns with gasps and its affectionate romance with adoring coos. Hours of hard work in staging the show and perfecting the dance numbers were validated through positive feedback, not to mention the learning points each member of the ensemble – whether experienced or new to the stage – took away from the production.

  

This show was only made possible through the efforts of our passionate cast, indefatigable crew and patient and dedicated teachers – Mrs Geetha Creffield, Ms Michelle Wong, Ms Annabel Tan, Mdm Baljeet Kaur, Mr Tobias Teo and Mr Jeremy Wong. An additional thank you goes out to our choreographer, Mr Gerard Sebastian Raj, who brought the magic of the show to life through energetic ensemble dances and intimate duets alike.

  

Last, but certainly not least, we would like to thank our school leaders, teachers, alumni, parents, peers and all other audience members for their indispensable support and encouragement. We invite all of you to join us next year for our adaptation of Shakespeare’s&nbsp;_As You Like It_, which will be our most ambitious, funny and romantic show yet!

  

_To God Be The Glory,_&nbsp; <br>
_The Best Is Yet To Be!_
