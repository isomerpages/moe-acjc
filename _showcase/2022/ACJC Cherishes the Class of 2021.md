**Jerica Pai Juanne Hwei** <br>
Jerica is a 2021 ACJC Performance Arts Award recipient, and was the President of the ACJC Choir. The Covid-19 pandemic brought specific challenges for vocal performance with a need for even more restrictive measures than many other co-curricular activities due to the nature of the performances. Jerrica ably led the Choir to adapt to these challenges, through safe yet rigorous socially distanced training programmes. Despite these difficulties, the College Choir rose to the challenge, clinching a Special Mention at the Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation 2021 where, under Jerica’s leadership, the Choir was recognised under ‘special provision’ conditions. She also brought the Choir into the community through the Choir’s traditional Values-in-Action Christmas Caroling project and the annual concert ‘An Evening with Friends’, conducted in accordance with the prevailing Safe Management Measures. The Choir remained an integral part of College events as Jerica helmed their participation in modified Teachers Day and National Day commemorations. Jerica is also the recipient of the school’s Outstanding Service Award and a member of the Principal’s Honour Roll.
