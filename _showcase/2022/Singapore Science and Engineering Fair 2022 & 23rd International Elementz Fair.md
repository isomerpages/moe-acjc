## <center> Singapore Science and Engineering Fair 2022 &amp; 23rd International Elementz Fair </center>

The Singapore Science and Engineering Fair (SSEF) 2022 is a national competition organised by the Ministry of Education (MOE), the Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A\*STAR) and the Science Centre Singapore for students to showcase their passion in research and communicate their findings to experts from the industry. The SSEF Final Judging Round was held online on 30th March and comprises two segments. In the first segment, finalists submitted a project presentation document, a quad chart and a two-minute video. The second segment required them to attend a live virtual session to answer questions posed by the expert judges.&nbsp;

  
This year, ACJC submitted 7 projects for the SSEF 2022, of which 4 were shortlisted for the Final Judging Round.&nbsp;

In addition, ACJC participated in the 23rd International Elementz Fair 2022, which was organised by ASRJC. 4 projects were submitted, of which, 3 were shortlisted for the Final Judging Round conducted on 19th April. The finalists presented their project findings via Zoom, and answered questions posed by the expert judges.

We are pleased to announce our achievements.

_Award Winners for SSEF and Elementz Fair:&nbsp;Eddrick Livando (2SB1), Max Tan Kia Lok (2SA1), Choo Li Xuan (2SC6), Anna Sim Jia Ping (2SC6), Tan Rae Lynn (2MD1), Robert Livando (2SB1) and Chan Chern En Joseph (2SA1)_

2 Merit Awards at the SSEF 2022:  

Chan Chern En Joseph (2SA1) and Robert Livando (2SB1) received the Merit Award for their project titled “Analysis of a Two-Terminal All Perovskite Tandem Solar Cell through Neural Network-based Application”

  

Max Tan Kia Lok (2SA1) and Eddrick Livando (2SB1) received the Merit Award for his project titled “Detection and Classification of Chromosomal Mutations in Metaphases for Radiation Damage”

  

“We began the project with only the basics of Python in hand, which led to a steep learning curve for learning how to write the script for a neural network. In spite of this, we persevered and worked hard to circumvent the obstacles that we faced along the way. Eventually we were able to modify a neural network model to achieve our goal.&nbsp;

  

During the final judging, we had to explain our project to judges who were also experts in their fields, thus it was important to understand our project well so that we could better answer their questions. Looking at the overall timeline of the project, our research lasted from Nov 2021 to Jan 2022. A good portion of the research was done during the holidays and hence it is important to balance our holiday homework with research.”&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
