## <center> Pixel Labs: Lions Home School Video Competition 2022 </center>

Delve into the alleyways of Chinatown and sneak a peek of what olden Singapore was like! 

ACJC Pixel Labs took part in the Lions Home School Video Competition 2022 in early 2022, organised by Lions Home For The Elders. The team comprised Melody Chew (2SB4), Darren Lee (2SC3), Laxshan Seharan (2SB1), Jai Ganesh (2SB3), Mah Wen Jie (2SB1), Natalie Yeo (2SC2), Ong Si Ying (2SB3) and Sean Hoe (2SA1).

The result was announced in April 2022 after careful consideration by a panel of judges and voting by the residents of Lions Home Bishan and Bedok. We are pleased to report that we have emerged victorious among 39 entries. Together with two student representatives (Darren and Sean), our teacher-in-charge (TIC), Mrs Elaine Yong, attended the prize presentation ceremony graced by Lion Loh Yan Poh (Volunteer Social Outreach Chairman), Mr Christopher Teo (Deputy CEO), and Ms Patsy Pang (Director of Nursing). We would like to thank Lions Home For The Elders for the invaluable opportunity!

The team, led by Melody, conceptualised the video for the theme “Singapore’s Colourful Story”, exploring the culturally rich alleys of Chinatown. To showcase the Singaporean Colours, the team decided to feature the historical art murals in Chinatown which resonated with the older generation of Singaporeans. Through the featuring of the art murals, our team also aimed to evoke a sense of appreciation for the local talent, particularly the artworks of Singaporean artist Yip Yew Chong. The time put into planning, filming, and editing has indeed paid off, as they have reaped the fruits of their labour.
