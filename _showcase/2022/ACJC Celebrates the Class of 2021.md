## <center> ACJC Celebrates the Class of 2021 </center>

On the 22nd of February 2022, ACJC received the GCE A-Level examination results for the Class of 2021. In keeping with Safe Management Measures (SMM), the release of the results was decentralised, with the Class of 2021 receiving their results from their form teachers in their classrooms. The College broadcast a livestream from the Principal, Dr. Shirleen Chee, who welcomed the alumni back to their alma mater and affirmed their tenacity in spite of all the challenges of the pandemic.

The College is proud to announce that the Class of 2021 have achieved excellent results, a true testament to their hard work, dedication, and determination. No less than 97.4% of our 683 students achieved the MOE indicator of “_percentage of candidates obtaining at least 3 H2 passes, with a pass in GP or KI_”, surpassing the national average of 93.5%. The Mean Ranking Points for the cohort also leave them well-positioned for the way forward. 

  

The Class of 2021 experienced unprecedented challenges across their two years in College, but they met these challenges with tenacity and passion. During the weeks of full home-based learning in both 2020 and 2021, they worked with discipline and a cheerful attitude, keeping their eyes fixed on their goal. They brought their juniors through a safely-distanced Orientation 2021 to ensure they had an enjoyable and safe introduction to ACJC. They commemorated key milestones of the school, such as the 46th Student Council Investiture with God’s Grace under the prevailing safe management measures. The Class of 2021 maintained the College’s sterling performance in Science Enrichment through events such as the 10th International Biomedical quiz where we achieved a wide variety of awards, and the 42nd International C. B. Paul Science Quiz 2021 which was reconceptualised and launched in a new online format with over 1000 participants from local and overseas secondary schools taking the Online Quiz.

  

Despite the pandemic, the Class of 2021 strove hard on the sports field, and despite the restricted National Schools Games, they did us proud. Of particular note were the Girls Bowling team who clinched the A Division title in a spectacular fashion, with an unprecedented clean sweep of all the medals on offer, winning the Gold, Silver, and Bronze in the Singles, Doubles, and Quartets events. Our Golfers also did well, bagging two individual medals for 3rd position. Our students competed in the Wushu A Division Girls 2nd International Sword and Spear events, finishing 3rd and 5th respectively. In the Shooting 10m Air Rifle Men event, we clinched a Bronze medal. Across the different sporting CCAs, our athletes in our recreational and competitive teams have trained and developed themselves despite the disruptions to national competitions and sporting events. Encouraging a spirit of excellence, the sports CCA leaders and seniors have encouraged their teams with dedication and good cheer. 

  

Our strength in the performing arts was undimmed by adaptations to the times. Our students strove, excelled and overcame all challenges with the Concert Band, Guitar Ensemble, AC Dance, Indian Dance and the String Ensemble all attaining Certificates of Distinction at the Singapore Youth Festival. In addition the members of the ACJC Choir and ACSian Theatre blazed new paths in digitalization, conducting entire performances online. Our clubs and societies likewise came together to collaborate on Safe Management Measure compliant blended and online events ranging from Arts Night organised by the Arts Council to AC Games by the Students’ Council. These safe and secure events were made possible through the contribution of ACSians in Pixel Labs and the Media Resource Crew, securing the technological backbone of the newly conceptualised online and blended events.

At the end of a busy year, the Class of 2021 took their A-Level examinations with additional safety measures with calm purpose, in the assurance that they had fought the good fight and done their best, with the support of their teachers, parents, and the whole ACJC community. 

  

We give thanks for each and every member of the Class of 2021, and wish them all the best for the next phase of their journey. 

  

The College would further like to thank all who have played a part in the success of the Class of 2021: our dedicated staff, the ever-supportive parents, and the wider ACS and Methodist family.

  

Most of all, we give thanks to God for His infinite goodness.

  

_To God be the Glory! The Best is Yet to Be!_
