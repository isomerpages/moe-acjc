## <center> ACJC Celebrates the Class of 2021 </center>

On the 22nd of February 2022, ACJC received the GCE A-Level examination results for the Class of 2021. In keeping with Safe Management Measures (SMM), the release of the results was decentralised, with the Class of 2021 receiving their results from their form teachers in their classrooms. The College broadcast a livestream from the Principal, Dr. Shirleen Chee, who welcomed the alumni back to their alma mater and affirmed their tenacity in spite of all the challenges of the pandemic.
