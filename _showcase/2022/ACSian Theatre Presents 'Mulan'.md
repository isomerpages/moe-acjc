## <center> ACSian Theatre Presents 'Mulan' </center>

On the 5th and 6th of August 2022, ACSian Theatre’s batch of 2023 presented our first JC1 club production,&nbsp;_Mulan_. Based on the ancient Chinese legend, the&nbsp;_Ballad of Mulan_, the play tells the classic story of Hua Mulan, a free-spirited young woman, who disguises herself as a male soldier in the Han army to fight the Rouran invaders in place of her ageing father.

Featuring exhilarating wushu combat sequences and intricate Chinese dance, the performance amazed and thrilled audiences. Furthermore, it was a valuable learning experience for the cast, who got the privilege to learn new sets of skills from experienced instructors.&nbsp;_Mulan_&nbsp;allowed the cast to experience the joy of working as an ensemble, growing together as performers and as a company in the process.

  

This production would not have been possible without the continued dedicated support and guidance of our teachers – Mrs Geetha Creffield, Ms Michelle Wong, Ms Annabel Tan, Mdm Baljeet Kaur, Mr Tobias Teo and Mr Jeremy Wong.

  

We would also like to express our gratitude for the passionate mentorship of our instructors – Mr Randell Siow and Mr Teo Wei Hong – who patiently trained us in martial arts and Chinese dance respectively. Last but not least, we extend our appreciation to our school leaders, teachers, parents and peers for their invaluable support and enthusiasm.
