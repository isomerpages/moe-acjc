For the JC2 students, this showcase was the final time they would be showing their self-devised and fully developed work to the public. An excited audience was able to see the students’ dedicated effort for theatre shown through a variety of performances – from Natalie Sng’s empowering movement piece inspired by the story of the&nbsp;_Twelve Dancing Princesses_&nbsp;to Dexter Yeo’s sobering performance that highlighted the struggles of single fathers and families hit by COVID-19 retrenchments.&nbsp;

  

Tyler Ng’s contemporised adaptation of the Grand Guignol, complete with a presentation showing off the special effects makeup and costuming he created as a costumer. Ewan Lim’s reflective piece about need to seize the day and live life to the fullest was evocatively captured with the use of the waltz.&nbsp;_The Weight of Silk of Skin_&nbsp;by Huzir Sulaiman was powerfully performed by Jalal Gilani and his partners. Pearline Chong presented the Chinese myth of Lei Gong and Lei Zi, the Thunder God and Lightning Goddess, with choreographed fight and dance sequences. Victoria Lam’s adaptation of Steven Sondheim’s&nbsp;_Company_&nbsp;explored loneliness and the need for genuine and loving human connections left the audience in awe.

  

The JC1 class performed monologues of their choice and were excited to show their growth since their Theasthai exam showcase.&nbsp; Bryan Ong performed a monologue about a teenager who has to give a class speech about a living hero. Dylan Leong performed a piece from Harish Shama’s&nbsp;_Off-Centre_, sharing the struggles of being diagnosed with a mental illness. Danil Syrov played Biff from Arthur Miller’s&nbsp;_Death of a Salesman_, with a monologue about deep disillusionment and failing to meet his father’s expectations.

  

The DEP Class of 2022 and 2023 would like to give our deepest gratitude to the principals, teachers, parents, masterclass trainers, performance partners and friends for their unwavering support throughout the entire process of devising, developing and rehearsing their pieces.&nbsp;
