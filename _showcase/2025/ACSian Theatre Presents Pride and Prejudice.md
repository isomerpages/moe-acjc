<p>Our production of Pride and Prejudice brought the classic Jane Austen
novel to life on stage, combining romance, wit and period elegance in a
captivating performance. ACSian Theatre brought Austen’s world from page
to stage with humorous moments, heart-rending scenes, and a re-imagined
aesthetic for this contemporised adaptation.</p>
<p>Set in early nineteenth century England, the performance explored the
themes of love, class and social expectations. The play follows the Bennet
family — led by the determined mother, Mrs Bennet, whose mission in life
is to marry off her five daughters to wealthy suitors. At the heart of
the drama are Elizabeth Bennet and Mr Darcy, whose sharp minds and clashing
personalities spark a slow journey towards mutual understanding.</p>
<p>The cast worked tirelessly to bring the beloved characters to life, with
each rehearsal filled with laughter, sweat and the joy of interacting with
each other. We also learnt various dances along with the stances, gestures
and terminology specific to each. This included understanding the épaulement
lines of our shoulders, executing the port de bras arms and most importantly,
the plié as we curtsy.</p>
<p>We would like to thank our beloved teachers — Mrs. Geetha Creffield, Ms.
Michelle Wong, Ms. Annabel Tan, Mr. Tobias Teo, Mdm. Baljeet Kaur and Mr
Noah Lee and our dance choreographer, Dr. Filomar Cortezano Tariao. Without
them, this production would not have been possible. We would also like
to extend our heartfelt thanks to our alumni for their support throughout
this production, whether it was onstage, backstage, in the tech-box or
in the audience.</p>
<p>We are also beyond grateful to our school leaders, teachers, parents,
crew and peers for their consistent support and encouragement!</p>
<p>Finally, we would like to thank the fantastic audience for their support
and enthusiasm. We are glad that our production has brought cheer and delight
to everyone.</p>
<p>As we close the curtains on this chapter, the ACSian Theatre JC2s will
take with us the memories and lessons of a pretty in pink journey!&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>To God be the Glory, The Best is Yet to Be!</em>
