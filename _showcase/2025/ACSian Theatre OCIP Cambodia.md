<br>From the 2nd to the 7th of June 2025, ACSian Theatre had the wonderful
opportunity to travel to the capital of Cambodia, Phnom Penh, as part of
the ACJC Humanities, Language and Performing Arts Cultural Exchange Programme!</p>
<p></p>
<p>The members of ACSian Theatre were beyond thrilled to have this opportunity
to perform for various organisations helping to provide holistic and vocational
education to children and teenagers. We are grateful to have a warm welcome
from the Isaiah Organization, the Methodist School of Cambodia, and Don
Bosco School.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Everyone in ACSian Theatre worked tirelessly to learn dances, ranging
from nostalgic pieces like “Mamma Mia” to songs from world-renowned K-pop
group BTS. We also performed and inclusive and interactive play titled
“The Day I Met The Prince”, inspired by the beloved and inspiring story
by Antoine de Saint-Exupéry.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Apart from performing to audiences, our CCA members also had the delightful
chance to interact with children ranging across different ages. Through
workshops hosted by our CCA leaders, we were able to share the joy of performance
and learning together with our Cambodian friends. We are immensely grateful
for the host organisations’ consistent kindness, participation and warm
welcome!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally, we thoroughly enjoyed immersing ourselves in Cambodian culture
at the Champey Academy of Arts. We were thrilled to watch traditional dance
styles and musical instruments performed by the students there, and even
got to learn basic steps of various cultural dances ourselves.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Finally, we had the rare opportunity to travel to the Singapore Embassy
of Cambodia, where we were able to discover the vast history of the partnership
between Singapore and Cambodia. By participating in insightful conversations
with the representatives at the Embassy, we further understood the importance
of having international ties in Singapore. The visit also taught as how
we can work towards further deepening and improving our relationship with
other countries in the ASEAN region and the world at large.</p>
<p>We would like to express our heartfelt gratitude to the various communities
that made this OCIP and experiential trip possible. We would like to firstly
thank the students and teachers of Isaiah Organization, the Methodist School
of Cambodia, and Don Bosco school. Thank you for the active participation,
indescribable amounts of energy and your immense hospitality, love and
care for all of us.</p>
<p></p>
<p>We would also like to thank our accompanying teachers for this trip: Mrs.
Geetha Creffield, Ms. Michelle Wong, Ms. Teo Shu May, Ms. Justine Light,
Mr. George Fu, Mr. Tobias Teo, Mr. Noah Lee and Mr. Dexx Han Yi Xian. Thank
you for the guidance and unwavering support throughout the journey, and
for giving us this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to be blessed and bless
those we met in Cambodia.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our heartfelt thanks also goes out to our dance instructor and choreographer,
Mr Gerard S Raj. Thank you for the never-ending patience and support, as
well as your diligence to painstakingly choreograph and teach us the various
dances.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All in all, the OCIP trip was both a fulfilling and a meaningful experience
that is etched in all of our hearts. It was a true honour to be able to
perform, learn and experience the culture in Cambodia.</p>
