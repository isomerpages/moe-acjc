<p>On Friday, 31 October 2025, the ACJC Humanities Department proudly hosted
the latest instalment of DIALOGIC: The ACJC Distinguished Guest Lecture
in History. The event brought together approximately 190 students and educators
from five colleges for an afternoon of deep historical inquiry and intellectual
exchange.</p>
<p>Our distinguished guest speaker, Dr Jennifer Yip, Assistant Professor
in the Department of History at the National University of Singapore (NUS),
delivered a compelling lecture on how China’s wartime military strategies
fundamentally reshaped civilian lives.</p>
<p>The session offered a unique lens on the Second Sino-Japanese War, moving
beyond high-level military tactics to explore:</p>
<p>• The Civilian Lynchpin: How ordinary men, women, and children became
essential to China’s "protracted war" and its joint efforts with the United
States in the Pacific Theatre.</p>
<p>• Historical Memory: How the trauma and triumphs of the war are remembered
today, particularly through the lens of modern online discourse in East
Asia.</p>
<p>The lecture served as a vital academic bridge for students across two
key disciplines:</p>
<p>• For History Students: The session provided essential context for H1
and H2 History syllabuses, illustrating how the legacy of WWII dictated
China's post-war domestic trajectory and foreign policy.</p>
<p>• For China Studies in English Students: As 2025 marks the 80th anniversary
of China’s victory in WWII, the lecture offered critical insights into
how historical memory continues to complicate contemporary China-Japan
relations.</p>
<p>The event concluded with a dynamic Q&amp;A session, where students engaged
directly with Dr Yip to clarify nuances of the conflict and the enduring
power of historical narratives.</p>
