<p>On 21 May 2025, our college had the privilege of hosting Dr. Lin HongXuan,
Assistant Professor from the Department of Southeast Asian Studies at the
National University of Singapore. Dr. Lin shared his expertise on the evolution
of separatist movements in Indonesia from 1945 to the present day.</p>
<p>As a multi-ethnic and multi-religious nation, Indonesia embodies the profound
concept of diversity. While inclusive national narratives and state ideologies
often project an idealistic image of a nation that successfully broke the
shackles of colonial rule, the modern state is also a byproduct of that
very colonial brutality—a legacy that requires significant time, effort,
and lived experience to reconcile.</p>
<p>As highlighted in the lecture, Indonesia’s confrontational history with
Dutch rule set a precedent for the use of armed force to resolve differing
visions of the state, particularly during the Sukarno and Suharto eras.
These clashing perspectives range from the Darul Islam rebellion, which
sought to establish Islam as the state religion, to Papuan nationalists
who view the central government as a colonial successor infringing upon
their resources and rights.</p>
<p>Through this session, I came to realise that while the 'idealism' of Pancasila
promotes a multi-religious state with a goal of common humanity, it has
historically risked paying mere lip service to these values while suppressing
dissenting voices. As Indonesia matures, it must find space for these marginalised
perspectives and accept even 'inconvenient' historical truths to prevent
a return to civil strife.</p>
<p>Ultimately, I found it incredibly insightful to learn about these obscure
yet vital historical movements, which are essential to appreciating the
nuances of the modern state. Furthermore, this session offered a fascinating
glimpse into the Department of Southeast Asian Studies, shedding light
on their diverse approach to the region—exploring history not just through
the lens of the state, but through culture, film, and social practices.</p>
