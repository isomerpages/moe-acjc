<p>This year’s Barrel of Laughs featured a hilarious rendition of The 39
Steps (Even More Abridged), as performed by the fictional ACJC Drama Society.
The original play follows the ordinary Richard Hannay as his life is turned
upside down after encountering a mysterious spy. With epic police chases,
secret agents, and a little bit of romance, what could go wrong? Well,
this was a play where everything that could go wrong did go wrong in the
most amusing way. The Drama Society’s attempt at performing this riveting
play was plagued with issues such as a small and incompetent cast, forgotten
lines, and worst of all…a destructive crew member named Dennis.&nbsp;
<br>
</p>
<p>Met with roaring laughter from a thoroughly entertained audience, it is
safe to say that Barrel of Laughs 2025 was a success. This result would
not have been possible without the unconditional support from our teachers:
Mrs Geetha Creffield, Ms Michelle Wong, Mdm Baljeet Kaur, Mr Tobias Teo
and Ms Annabel Tan. We would also like to send our appreciation to the
cast and crew, especially the alumni who returned despite their busy schedules
to help out in this play.&nbsp;
<br>
</p>
<p>Lastly, we would like to thank our audience: for their laughter, support,
and love for ACSian Theatre.</p>
<p></p>
<p>To God be the Glory, the Best is Yet to Be!</p>
