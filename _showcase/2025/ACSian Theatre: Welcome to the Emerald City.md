<p>The play follows Dorothy, a young girl from Kansas, as she is whisked
off to a magical land by a tornado. As she wanders through the land in
search of Oz, the great wizard, she makes new friends and battles evil
witches! Ultimately, Dorothy learns that there is definitely no place like
home, and returns to Kansas.</p>
<p>Spectacular dances, and soft, soulful singing made up for a wonderful
and vibrant performance, which was met with an enthusiastic audience. It
was indeed a rewarding experience to learn these new skills and put them
together for the show!</p>
<p>We would like to thank our teachers—Mrs. Geetha Creffield, Ms. Michelle
Wong, Mr. Noah Lee, Mr. Tobias Teo, and Mdm. Baljeet Kaur. This production
was made possible with their endless support and guidance. We would also
like to extend our gratitude to our dance choreographer, Dr. Filomar Cortezano
Tariao, and our vocal coach, Mr. Adrian Poon, for bringing all of ACSian
Theatre’s shows to life.</p>
<p>Finally, we are exceedingly grateful to our school leaders, teachers,
parents, alumni, crew, and peers for their constant encouragement and aid
in our productions. Thank you for the support!</p>
<p>The Best is Yet To Be!</p>
