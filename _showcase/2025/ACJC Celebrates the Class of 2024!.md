in receiving their ‘A’-level certificates.</p>

<p>During their time at ACJC, the members of the Class of 2024 distinguished
themselves on the playing field, in performances, in clubs and societies,
in academics, and in their service to others. Above all, they will carry
with them the fruits of a holistic ACSian education. The College celebrates
all of them and in the coming days we will share some of their stories
.</p>
<p>We give thanks for each and every member of the Class of 2024 and wish
them all the best for the next phase of their journey. We know they will
display true ACSian Integrity, Tenacity and Passion to make a difference
in the world around them.</p>
<p>The College would further like to thank all who have played a part in
the success of the Class of 2023: our dedicated staff, the ever-supportive
parents, and the wider ACS and Methodist family.</p>
<p>Most of all, we give thanks to God for His infinite goodness.</p>
<p>To God be the Glory! The Best is Yet to Be!</p>
