<p>On the 6th of March 2025, ACJC’s Arts Ambassadors organised our very own
performing arts event, ACJC Fringe!</p>
<p>ACJC Fringe takes the place of the traditional Arts Night of previous
years in hopes of bringing the soothing and restorative qualities of the
performing arts to the wider College community throughout a typical school
day.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Students and teachers showcased their talents in a multitude of ways.
At the Main Lobby, performances included singing, storytelling, electric
guitar playing, poetry recitation and even musical theatre. The acts were
distinctive and captivating, with some eliciting enthusiastic audience
participation. There was even a special student-teacher collaboration that
featured a mash-up of 2 songs, one from each performer’s era, reflecting
the unifying potential and power of the performing arts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition, at the Void Deck, there was a special showcase by the Music
Elective Programme (MEP) students who serenaded the lunch crowd with classical
tunes and rousing vocals. To top it all off, there was a tactile activity
facilitated by the Art Department that encouraged free expression - Material
Play: Exploring Emotions through Art. By combining unexpected prompts,
participants created unique and thought-provoking artworks.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The audience was deeply engaged in all the performances, participating
actively and cheering passionately. They even held up lights during the
singing performances, creating a moving concert ambience. The riveting
performances at various venues on campus brought students and staff together
through the Arts. This truly brightened up school life and added to the
vibrant culture that is uniquely ACJC!&nbsp;</p>
<p>We look forward to cultivating a love of the Arts further in future events
and projects.&nbsp;

<p>To God be the Glory, The Best is Yet to Be!</p>
