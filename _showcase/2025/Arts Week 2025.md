<p>From 14th to 16th April, the Arts Faculty, supported by the student Arts
Ambassadors, organised <strong>Arts Week 2025: Imagining Other Worlds</strong>.</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>Arts Week aims to raise the profile of the Arts in the College community.
This year’s theme, <strong>Imagining Other Worlds</strong>, sought to prompt
students to consider alternative realities across time and space, developing
an appreciation for diversity. This was facilitated through the conduct
of a variety of fun-filled and laughter-inducing activities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>At the Main Lobby, <em>Impressions and Imagination</em> gave students the
chance to pause and peruse photographs taken by members of ACJC’s Photographic
Society. Through the manipulation of colour, light and shadows, different
versions of common scenes were unveiled, allowing one to have a different
take on the seemingly mundane. In addition, in a collaborative artwork <em>Make Your Mark</em>,
students engaged in the co-creation of an art piece with the rest of the
school community, using an atypical art material. Students marvelled at
the synergistic art piece that captured a range of different emotions and
messages!</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>At the walkway to the canteen, a trivia game hosted by ACJC’s Arts Ambassadors
tested students on their knowledge of various Arts subjects. The game had
many students and staff unleash their competitive streaks in hopes of emerging
victorious. Furthermore, with <em>All Rhyme and No Reason</em>, many brave
students took on tongue-rolling and mind-boggling Dr Seuss rhymes to see
how fast they could speak without tripping over their words! This was an
activity that allowed for the reminiscing of fond childhood memories.</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>ACJC’s Oldham Library saw the launch of a unique event: <em>The Mind’s Eye</em>,
which gives students the opportunity to share their unique reads with others,
with the aim of promoting a reading and reflective culture in our community.
Additionally, in an initiative embracing the art of silence, <em>Project Shhh</em> encouraged
students to simply… read in silence.</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>Sonder VII was an art exhibition filled with meaningful and thought-provoking
pieces by our H2 Art and Art Club students. These pieces came in numerous
forms and mediums — paintings, pottery, photographs, sculptures, film,
and more — each telling their own story, beckoning viewers to arrive at
their own interpretations of the works.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Apart from exciting activities scattered throughout the school day, there
were also special afternoon sessions catered to student&nbsp; interests.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One such session was on writing, drawing and publishing in Singapore,
featuring local authors, two of whom were ACJC’s very own teachers! Ms
Samantha Han, Mr Syam and alumnus/artist Jashorn came together to share
their publishing journey with students.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Jeyes Tan, a local singer-songwriter and an ACJC alumnus from the Class
of 2022, hosted an unplugged music session, peppered with anecdotes about
his musical journey. His unique sound and ability to transform his musings
into lyrics enabled him to connect with the listeners, making this a very
special experience.</p>
<p>The departments also arranged for guest lecturers and various learning
journeys to enrich students’ understanding of their subjects beyond the
curriculum.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Finally, the teachers ended Arts Week with an unforgettable bang, dressing
up as their favourite characters and challenging students to identify who
they were. From classic characters like Red Riding Hood and Alice in Wonderland,
to modern icons like Ken from <em>Barbie</em> and the emotions from <em>Inside Out</em>,
students were ecstatic to find their teachers decked out in brightly coloured
and over-the-top costumes. Striking particular awe, fear, and giggles in
students was a teacher who gleefully wore a matching outfit with his Labubu
doll, and a majestic and stately Hang Tuah.
<br>
</p>
<p>With that as the perfect end to Arts Week, the meaningful and memorable
activities undoubtedly brightened up school life and injected joy and vibrancy
into a culture that is uniquely ACJC!&nbsp;
<br>
</p>
<p>To quote John Keating from <em>Dead Poet’s Society</em>:&nbsp; ‘...poetry,
beauty, romance, love — these are what we stay alive for.’&nbsp;</p>
<p>Truly, Arts Week 2025 was an eye-opening experience for all students —
encapsulating the beauty and value of all aspects of the Arts, and reminding
all to never stop Imagining Other Worlds, because there truly is something
for everyone out there.
