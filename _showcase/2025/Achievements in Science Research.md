<p>We are proud to share the outstanding achievements of our students in
recent research competitions.</p>
<p><strong>Singapore Science and Engineering Fair (SSEF) 2025</strong>
<br>The SSEF is a prestigious national competition organised by the Ministry
of Education (MOE), the Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR),
and the Science Centre Singapore. It provides a platform for students to
showcase their passion for scientific research and to present their findings
to experts from academia and industry.</p>
