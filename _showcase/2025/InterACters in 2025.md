<p>In 2025, the Interact Club has continued to press forward in community
service!</p>
<p>The Merit Award for the District Interact Award 2024–2025 was conferred
upon <em>Festive Cheers</em> and <em>Project RestART</em>, two initiatives
that exemplify ACJC Interact Club’s unwavering commitment to its core value
of <em>Service Above Self</em>. This recognition affirms our members’ dedication
to service, with both projects addressing diverse social issues and demonstrating
how purposeful engagement can leave a lasting impact on both beneficiaries
and volunteers alike.</p>
<p><em>Festive Cheers 2025</em> was a heartfelt Chinese New Year initiative
comprising three service projects. In collaboration with the Rotary Club
of Jurong Town and long-standing community partners, over 50 Interactors
engaged 60–70 seniors through home cleaning, festive crafts, and heartfelt
conversations. The initiative not only uplifted the spirits and living
environments of the elderly, but also nurtured intergenerational understanding
and empathy.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Project RestART 2024</em>, a college-wide collaboration with the Yellow
Ribbon Project’s 20th anniversary, aimed to raise awareness for ex-offenders.
Through guided art tours and interactive booths, students explored the
personal stories and artistic talents of inmates and ex-offenders. Interactors
also facilitated card writing and collaborative artwork, showing support
through words of encouragement. The project fostered deeper understanding
of reintegration challenges and inspired students to view ex-offenders
beyond their labels, championing a more inclusive community.</p>
