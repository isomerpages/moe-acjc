<p>As part of the opening ceremony, ACSian Theatre grooved to a nostalgic
medley of ABBA songs and got the audience going with our energetic and
captivating performance. Our dance piece, consisting of popular ABBA hits
such as “Mamma Mia”, “Dancing Queen” and “Thank You For The Music”, explored
the famous dance genre of Disco and the fantastical vibes of that era.</p>
<p>Our performers worked immensely hard to bring our audience joy while watching
our dance, communicating the feelings of nostalgia, excitement and togetherness
through the high energy of each dance move. The experience was truly an
unforgettable one, as not only did we have the chance to perform in such
a grand venue, but it also allowed us to showcase our talents in an extremely
unique setting, and in the presence of world-renowned basketball stars
as well. This opportunity is one that we are endlessly grateful for. &nbsp;</p>
<p>We would like to thank our wonderful teachers — Mrs. Geetha Creffield,
Ms. Michelle Wong, Ms. Annabel Tan, Mr. Tobias Teo, Mdm. Baljeet Kaur,
and Mr. Noah Lee — as well as our dance choreographer, Mr. Gerard S Raj,
for their dedication and support. Additionally, we would like to extend
our gratitude to our school leaders, teachers, alumni, family and peers
for their support and motivation!</p>
<p>Last but not least, we are beyond grateful to our lovely audience at the
NBA Rising Stars Invitational for showing such enthusiasm in response to
our performance!</p>
