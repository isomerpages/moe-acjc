<p><strong>繋がり・connection</strong> was the 2025 theme of our bi-directional
cultural exchange marking the 36th Anniversary between ACJC and Tezukayama
High School. Overcoming the struggles and bridging ties across the pandemic,
our two institutions have sought to re-establish relationships, and sustain
the connections of performing arts and humanity that transcends language
and cultural barriers.</p>

<p>Welcoming our friends from Tezukayama High School from the 25<sup>th</sup> to
28<sup>th</sup> of March 2025, ACJC students were enthusiastic and eager
to meet and learn more from their Japanese peers. This cultural exchange
is only possible because of the foresight of Mr Wan Fook Weng, principal
of ACJC from 1986-1997. In 1989, he established ties with teachers and
school leaders of Tezukayama High School that has been continued by subsequent
principals, Mrs Lim Han Soon, Mrs Kelvyna Chan, Ms Beatrice Choong, and
Dr. Shirleen Chee.</p>
<p>The combined concert included all of ACJC’s performing arts CCAs and Tezukayama
High School’s Concert Band. With just two days of rehearsal together, the
combined ACJC-TZH Concert Band performed one piece each from Singapore
and Japan, Dr. Kelly Tang’s “Overture No. 2” and “Japanese Graffiti IV”,
an arrangement of music by the Japanese singer, Kosaku Dan, by Atsuhiro
Isozaki. Separately, each school’s band performed pieces from their own
repertoires.</p>
<p>This was followed by performances inspired by the diversity of music and
performances from both international and local cultures. ACJC Guitar, String
Ensemble, Choir, Dance and ACSian Theatre performed a variety of music
and dance genres that brought us to Europe, East Asia, the Indian Subcontinent
and Singapore. These performances were all well-received and thoroughly
enjoyed by our audience from within ACJC and our cluster schools.</p>
<p>The ACJC Performing Arts CCAs are grateful for the stewardship of our
principal, Dr Shirleen Chee, and vice-principals Mr Ang Yuan Peng, Ms Quek
Si Min, Ms Callista Lim. Our gratitude also goes to the numerous teachers,
students and friends for their continued support.</p>
<p>Last, but not least, we are deeply thankful and appreciative of the warmth
and sincerity of our friends from Tezukayama High School. We look forward
to many more years of friendship, collaboration, and artistic excellence
shared between our two schools!</p>
