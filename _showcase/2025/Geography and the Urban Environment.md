<p>In July 2025, a team of ACSian Geography students received the Merit Award
for the 2024 Challenge for the Urban and Built Environment (CUBE) workshop,
a prestigious competition organised annually by the Urban Redevelopment
Authority (URA) for pre-tertiary students.</p>
<p>The team, comprising Wong Zi Xuan, Jaden Yip, Jovin Kristanto, Sarah Chan,
Ooi Xi Ning, Caroline Tay, and Samuel Loh, was tasked with designing and
planning a land-use map for ‘Long Island’, demonstrating strong interdisciplinary
thinking, innovation, and creative problem-solving in addressing real-world
urban development issues.</p>
<p>Through this eye-opening experience, the team gained valuable exposure
to the complexities of urban planning and sustainable design, including
how industry-leading architects have integrated sustainable design principles
with existing architecture. Furthermore, the team also had the opportunity
to formulate and craft their own unique vision for a future Singapore.
From drafting comprehensive land-use plans that layered transport, green
spaces, housing, and commercial zones, to developing detailed concept art
with a focus on sustainable architecture, they had the privilege of acquiring
a diverse range of skills essential for shaping resilient and future-ready
cities.</p>

<p>Receiving the Merit Award stands as a testament to their dedication, teamwork,
and intellectual curiosity. Their achievement not highlights the potential
of youth in shaping more sustainable and inclusive cities, but also serves
as a reminder of the importance in appreciating the Government's efforts
in nurturing a harmonious and sustainable community for our entire society.</p>
