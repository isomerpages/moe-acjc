<p>On the 9th of April 2025, ACSian Theatre participated in the Indian Dance
category of the Singapore Youth Festival (SYF). With our electrifying performance
entitled ‘Come Dance!’ (வாங்க ஆடலாம் - Vaanga Aadalaam!), we are proud
to announce that we have been awarded the Certificate of Distinction!</p>

<p>The journey to our SYF performance showcase was both enriching and gratifying.
We learnt a variety of Indian dance forms during the months of preparation,
from Bharatanatyam to Bollywood! We had a joy dancing enthusiastically
to our dance track, which featured five songs in five different Indian
languages. On the day itself, we left it all out on stage, displaying our
effort and hardwork, lighting up the auditorium with our boundless energy!</p>
<p>We would like to give thanks to our choreographer, Mr Gerad S Raj! We
are all incredibly grateful for your expertise and grace. Thank you for
guiding us through this unparalleled experience! To our teachers –Mrs Geetha
Creffield, Ms Michelle Wong, Ms Annabel Tan, Mr Tobias Teo and Mdm Baljeet
Kaur– we want to thank you for your unwavering support and care!</p>
<p>We would also like to thank everyone who came down on the 9<sup>th</sup> of
April to cheer us on! Finally, we would like to congratulate all schools
who performed in this year’s SYF Indian Dance category. It was an honour
performing alongside such talents, all united in our appreciation for Indian
Dance!</p>
<p>To God Be The Glory, The Best Is Yet To Be!</p>
