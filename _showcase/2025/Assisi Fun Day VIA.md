<p>On June 15 2025, ACSian Theatre contributed to giving back to our community
by setting up a face-painting booth during the annual Assisi Fun Day at
St. Joseph's Institution International (SJII). With this Values-in-Action
(VIA) activity, we hope to have played a meaningful part in raising charity
funds to help Assisi Hospice in their cause of providing palliative care
to patients with life-limiting illnesses.</p>

<p>With passionate hearts and a great willingness to serve, this opportunity
has allowed our club members to spark joy in our visitors as we made the
day more colourful and vibrant. To prepare for this VIA activity, we had
face-painting workshops conducted by our JC2 seniors. Our ACSian Theatre
family is extremely grateful for this experience to strengthen our bonds
as a CCA serving the wider community with various playful designs and artistic
skills. Seeing the smiles and wonderful reactions to our handiwork at Assisi
Fun Day has also made this experience rewarding and purposeful.</p>
<p>Through this event, we have learnt and understood something important
- that the skills and values honed as ACSian Theatre members are able to
benefit not just our school, but the community around us as well.</p>
<p>We truly hope to continue giving back to the people around us, and be
invited back to continue journeying with Assisi Hospice in their cause
in the coming years!</p>
<p>To God be the Glory, The Best is Yet to Be!</p>
