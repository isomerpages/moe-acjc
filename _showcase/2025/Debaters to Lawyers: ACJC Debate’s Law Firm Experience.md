<p>The grand escalator leading up to the Rajah &amp; Tann office perfectly
set the tone for the firm’s impressive, polished environment. We were warmly
welcomed into a spacious meeting room overlooking the city and treated
to an array of chocolates and biscuits. There, Mr. Jonathan Yuen, an ACJC
debate alumnus and part of the first batch of Team Singapore’s competitors
in the World Schools’ Debating Championships, shared valuable insights
into the legal profession, from the diverse industries lawyers work with
to the realities of navigating professional life. We were especially struck
by how seamlessly the skills honed in debate can translate into legal practice.</p>
<p>The session’s most engaging moment was the Q&amp;A, where Mr Yuen spoke
candidly about his journey in law and the motivations that continue to
drive his work. Our visit concluded with a tour of the firm’s offices,
including its collaborative spaces and meeting rooms. The experience left
every debater inspired and deeply grateful for the opportunity to glimpse
the world of law up-close. We offer our sincere thanks to Mr Yuen.</p>
