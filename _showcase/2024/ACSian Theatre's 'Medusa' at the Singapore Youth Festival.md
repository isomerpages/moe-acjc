<p>ACSian Theatre’s ‘Medusa’ is an adaptation of the myth of the Greek hero
Perseus. He is aided by goddess Athena on his perilous journey to behead
Medusa and her sisters, bringing back their heads as a sign of victory.
The story of Medusa shows us the importance of perseverance and bravery
shown by Perseus and his soldiers as they battle against Medusa to emerge
victorious from the battle.</p>
<p>The ensemble faced challenges as they embarked on the journey of learning
how to tell this story through physical theatre. Despite initial difficulties,
they persevered and committed to mastering the art form. This collective
experience served as a powerful reminder of the significance of storytelling
and the incredible impact that a captivating performance can have on an
audience.</p>
<p>This achievement would not have been possible without the constant, never-ending
support of our teachers, alumni, and peers, who have never failed to put
a smile on our faces even after a long day of school.&nbsp;Special thanks
go to our school leaders, teachers and peers who attended our SYF performance
showcase at Gateway Theatre.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We would like to extend our sincerest gratitude to our teachers, Mrs Geetha
Creffield, Ms Michelle Wong, Ms Annabel Tan, Mr Tobias Teo and Mdm Baljeet
Kaur for their constant encouragement. We would also like to thank our
choreographer, Dr Filomar Tariao Cortezano for his passion and dedication
to making our stories come to life.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To God Be The Glory, The Best Is Yet To Be!</p>
