<p>From the 11th to the 13th of April 2024, the ACJC Debate and Oratorical
Society hosted the 10th International Oldham Cup, our first in-person international
event since the pandemic. This year's Oldham Cup welcomed nearly 50 teams
from Singapore and from around the world, providing the opportunity for
aspiring debaters to hone their skills and promote the art of competitive
debate.</p>
<p>A myriad of societal issues were discussed, from the use of Artificial
Intelligence in the criminal justice system to the harms of certain narratives
in children's media. By the end of the three days, friends were made, perspectives
were exchanged, and trophies were won.</p>
<p>3 of our ACJC Debaters proudly emerged as Top 20 Best Speakers, with ACJC
Red ranking 5th out of 46 teams, placing us as the top JC team.</p>
<p>Our immense gratitude goes to the Chief Adjudication Panel, our teachers,
coach, volunteers, and of course â€“ all the debaters for the success of
the event! We look forward to another successful rendition of the Oldham
Cup next year!&nbsp;</p>
