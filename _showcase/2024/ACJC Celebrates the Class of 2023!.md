<p>On the 23rd of February 2024, ACJC received the GCE A-Level examination
results for the Class of 2023.</p>
<p>The College is proud to announce that the Class of 2023 have achieved
excellent results, a true testament to their hard work, dedication, and
determination. They have done extremely well in terms of their percentage
passes and distinctions and carry with them the fruits of a holistic ACSian
education. They are well positioned for the way forward and in the coming
days we will be sharing some of their stories.</p>
<p>During their time at ACJC, the members of the Class of 2023 have distinguished
themselves on the playing field, in performances, in clubs and societies,
in academics, and in their service to others. The College celebrates all
of them.</p>
<p>We give thanks for each and every member of the Class of 2023 and wish
them all the best for the next phase of their journey. We know they will
display true ACSian Integrity, Tenacity and Passion to make a difference
in the world around them.</p>
<p>The College would further like to thank all who have played a part in
the success of the Class of 2023: our dedicated staff, the ever-supportive
parents, and the wider ACS and Methodist family.</p>
<p>Most of all, we give thanks to God for His infinite goodness.</p>
<p>To God be the Glory! The Best is Yet to Be!</p>
