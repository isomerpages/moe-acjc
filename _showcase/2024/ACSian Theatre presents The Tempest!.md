<p>The Tempest is a classic Shakespearean tale touching on the human conditions
of vengeance and empathy, ambition, and acceptance. This exciting production
tells the story of a group of helpless sailors who get shipwrecked on a
mysterious island inhabited by magical creatures. The island is ruled by
a powerful sorceress — Prosperina. With her loyal servant, Ariel, she plays
magical tricks on the sailors as revenge for exiling her ten years ago.
Meanwhile, the monster of the island, Caliban, has grown bitter at Prosperina’s
rule and wants to take the island for himself.</p>
<p>Both JC2s and JC1s came together to put this play together, pouring their
hearts into making a spectacular performance with its vibrant dances and
harmonious choral singing. The show ended with a great shebang — to rollicking
tunes and joyous laughter! Not only does this performance mark the end
of the JC2’s time on the stage, it also begins the transition to the JC1s
taking the lead.</p>
<p>We could not have done it without the help of our wonderful teachers:
Mrs Geetha Creffield, Ms Michelle Wong, Mdm Baljeet Kaur, Mr Tobias Teo
and Ms Annabel Tan. We would like to thank these amazing teachers who dedicated
themselves to supporting ACSian Theatre. Another special thanks to our
choreographer, Dr. Filomar Cortezano, for carefully guiding us through
the lively dances and the animated movement sequences. We would also like
to extend our gratitude to our loyal alumni who came back to support our
members, in both performance and crewing. Thank you for returning to help
us!</p>
<p>Lastly, a big thank you to the audience members for their never-ending
support! We hope you have thoroughly enjoyed this production of The Tempest.</p>
<p>To God be the Glory, The Best is Yet to Be!</p>
