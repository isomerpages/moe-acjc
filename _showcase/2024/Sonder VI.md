<p>Sonder is a word that represents the realisation that every stranger is
living a life as vivid and complex as our own.</p>

<p>The exhibition provided a platform for student artists to demonstrate
their creativity and skills through various art forms, such as drawings,
paintings, sculptures, pottery, fashion, installation and animation. A
wide range of thematic ideas were explored, from lighthearted animated
fantasies, to illustrated philosophical musings, and even conceptual experiments.</p>

<p>This year’s show attracted students, teachers, alumni, parents and visitors
from other schools, who commented on the stimulating and thought provoking
ideas presented, and were awed by the aesthetic appeal of the exhibits,
praising the skill and creativity of the works presented. Visitors were
guided by student docents from Art Club who provided insightful commentary
as they explored the gallery.</p>
<p>
<br>We would like to express our gratitude to our visitors, our school leaders,
HOD (Arts) Mrs Geetha Creffield, as well as our teacher-in-charge, Ms Clio
Ding, and our ceramics instructor, Mr Richard Lim, for their unwavering
support and guidance. Most importantly, we want to thank God for without
Him, none of this would have been possible.</p>

<p>To God be the Glory, The Best Is Yet To Be!</p>
