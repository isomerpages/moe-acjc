<p>The Singapore Mathematical Olympiad is organised by the Singapore Mathematics
Society,</p>
<p>and aims to test the ingenuity and mathematical problem-solving ability
of the participants. Our students achieved both Silver and Bronze awards:</p>
<p>Silver Award:</p>
<p>• 1SA1 Ho Shan Peng Josiah</p>
<p>• 1SA5 Jack Michael Rowsing Martens</p>
<p>• 2SA6 Eng Jun Jie</p>
<p>Bronze Award:</p>
<p>• 1SA5 Esther Gabriella</p>
<p>• 1SA6 Justin Toh Jing Hao</p>
<p>• 2SA6 Caleb Teo Rae-Shaun</p>
<p>• 2SA6 Hansel Choo Yi Xuan</p>
<p>• 2SA6 Siddharth Chitra Krishnan</p>
<p>• 2SA6 Yeo Zheng Yu</p>
<p>• 2SC2 Lim Hung Kang</p>
<p>The International Mathematical Modelling Challenge (IM²C) is an international
competition on</p>
<p>mathematical modelling. The purpose of the IM²C is to promote the teaching
of mathematical</p>
<p>modelling and applications. The team must work collaboratively over a
period of five days to</p>
<p>solve a problem by developing and applying an original mathematical model.
The IM²C</p>
<p>(Singapore) is held between Singapore schools under the same rules and
format as the</p>
<p>international competition.</p>
<p>ACJC was awarded the Certificate of Distinction</p>
<p>Team members:</p>
<p>• 2MD1 Low Yew Qing</p>
<p>• 2SA5 Jethro Tjiunardi</p>
<p>• 2SA6 Hansel Choo Yi Xuan</p>
<p>• 2SB4 Joe Wong</p>
<p>The Euclid Mathematics Contest is organised by the University of Waterloo
and consist of a</p>
<p>mix of short-answer and full-solution questions that give students the
opportunity to solve</p>
<p>innovative problems using their creativity. ACSians receiving Certificates
of Distinction were:</p>
<p>• 1SA2 Tan Teng Juan</p>
<p>• 1SA5 Lau Cheng Xun</p>
<p>• 1SA5 Li Zeyu</p>
<p>• 1SA5 Tran Bao Ngoc</p>
<p>• 1SC1 Lim Jian-Kai</p>
<p>• 2SA6 Siddharth Chitra Krishnan</p>
<p>• 2SB7 Lee Haeun</p>
<p>The Shanghai TI Cup Math Contest is jointly organised by the Math Research
Institute of</p>
<p>Shanghai Education Commission and Texas Instruments, and is open to JC1
students from</p>
<p>Singapore and Grade 11 students from China. It aims to develop students
mathematical skills</p>
<p>and their ability to explore the use of graphic calculators to solve practical
problems and we are proud that our candidates received Level 2 and 3 Awards.</p>
<p>Level 2 Award:</p>
<p>• 1SA2 Jonas Tan Yan Kai</p>
<p>Level 3 Award:</p>
<p>• 1SA3 Yeap Kingsley</p>
<p>• 1SA7 See Sheau Rou</p>
<p>• 1SB6 Lim Xin Way</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Graphing Calculator (GC) Grand Prix is organised by Tampines-Meridian
Junior College</p>
<p>and sponsored by Texas Instruments. It aims to enhance students’ competency
in the</p>
<p>functions and operations of the GC and promote skills that would be useful
for students to</p>
<p>acquire to solve real-world problems.</p>
<p>The team from ACJC were 1st runners up.</p>
