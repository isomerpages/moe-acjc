this way.”</p>

<p>On the 24th and 25th of November 2023, ACSian Theatre presented its annual
end-of-year production The Nutcracker! The Nutcracker follows the journey
of Clara, an imaginative young girl whose Nutcracker is magically brought
to life on Christmas night. They both encounter the villainous Mouse King
through their journey from the comforts of Clara’s home to Candyland, braving
the icy palace of the Snow Queen and marvelling at the waltzing flowers
and dancing sweets. Hearts of the audience were warmed at the sight of
family and friends coming together in this Christmas play.</p>
<p>It was our immense pleasure and honour to receive such an incredibly energetic
response from the audience on both nights. The many hours of hard work
in making this show come to life were all definitely worth it upon hearing
the waves of laughter and gasps of curiosity go around throughout the performance.
This momentous experience taught every member of the cast—with or without
prior experience—many lessons to take away from this production.</p>

<p>On the 16th and 17th of February 2024, ACSian Theatre presented its annual
alumni comedy show - and first production of the year - Barrel of Laughs:
Change the Channel!</p>
<p>This year’s Barrel of Laughs consisted of satirical playlets based on
well-worn television tropes, from ridiculous game shows to heart-wrenching
soap operas. The audience giggled, chuckled, and guffawed through the night
as they watched the network producer of Channel BOL desperately struggle
to keep his show afloat…all while competing against a fierce new rival.</p>
<p>Not one, not two, but five batches of ACSian Theatre were together this
year to make one big, hilarious performance. Alumni and members of the
current ACSian Theatre JC2 Batch of 2024 worked tirelessly to make Barrel
of Laughs: Change the Channel! a show to remember.</p>
<p>These two ACSian Theatre productions owe their success to the dedicated
cast, tireless crew, and patient teachers, including Mrs Geetha Creffield,
Ms Michelle Wong, Ms Annabel Tan, Mdm Baljeet Kaur, and Mr Tobias Teo.
Special appreciation goes to our choreographer, Mr. Filomar Cortezano Tariao,
who brought the shows to life with lively group dances and heartfelt duets.</p>
<p>Finally, we express gratitude to our school leaders, teachers, alumni,
parents, peers, and all audience members for their invaluable support.
We extend an invitation to everyone to join us next year for our rendition
of Shakespeare’s The Tempest. You will be in for a storm. See you there!</p>
<p>To God be the Glory, The Best is Yet to Be!</p>
