<p>On 1st March 2024, the ACS family of schools commemorated the 138th anniversary
of Bishop Oldham's establishment of a humble school located in a shophouse
on Amoy Street, which has, by the grace of God's blessing, since grown
to comprise a range of educational institutions which nurture and guide
the next generation based on core Methodist values.</p>

<p>ACJC was honoured to welcome Associate Professor Ong Biauw Chi, Group
Chief Risk Officer at Singhealth, and College alumna, one of the many frontline
healthcare personnel who led us through the pandemic crisis as our Guest
of Honour for the ceremony. Associate Professor Ong spoke eloquently and
meaningfully about her time at ACJC and the lifelong lessons she has carried
forward into her illustrious career.</p>
<p>Together with the other guests, members of staff, and students past and
present, we celebrated the AC legacy. The College recognised the outstanding
abilities of our ACSians as awards were presented to students from the
ACJC Class of 2022, 2023, and 2024 for their academic and co-curricular
achievements, recognizing their contributions to the College and the continuation
of the proud tradition of the AC schools.</p>
