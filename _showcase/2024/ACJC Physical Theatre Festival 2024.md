<p>This year, the ACJC Physical Theatre Festival: The Teller and The Tale
has returned to the main stage of the Centre of Performing Arts. This is
an exciting event that celebrates the art of gestural and physical storytelling.
In a series of exciting performances on 24 August 2024, the audience truly
saw the vibrant energy youths today bring to theatre-making.</p>

<p>The first performance by Kranji Secondary School was a light-hearted and
energetic piece about the characters’ clever problem-solving skills by
finding their way out of a living escape room. This was followed by ‘WHAT
IF?’ by ACS Barker, a poignant performance that explored themes of inclusiveness
and acceptance in the school environment.</p>
<p>Continuing the idea of inclusive diversity, ACJC’s ACSian Theatre presented
‘Time Dancer’, a meaningful dance item portraying the diversity of races
and identities in Singapore with powerful poignancy. Tanjong Katong Girls’
School then performed a dynamic piece that depicted the tales of three
powerful women from Asian history. Titled ‘Burning Waters’, this performance
pays tribute to the women’s shared indomitable spirit across their different
cultures.</p>
<p>Next, Singapore Chinese Girls’ School performed ‘Fire-Flies’. This thought-provoking
piece explores themes of fitting in and belonging through the trials faced
by persons forcibly displaced from their homes. Finally, the festival ended
with a fantastical tale of cunning and wit with ACJC’s ACSian Theatre telling
the story of Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves. This performance was extracted
from “One Thousand and One Nights” that was first performed in August by
the JC1 cast.</p>
<p>We want to appreciate all participating schools and teachers for their
attendance at this year’s Physical Theatre Festival. The commitment they
made to their performances through both body and text was truly remarkable
to see, and we hope it made a deep and lasting impact on every member of
the audience. This thanks also extends to the backstage crew comprised
of volunteers from Tampines Meridian Junior College’s Drama Elective Programme.</p>
<p>We would also like to thank our school leaders, teachers and friends for
their continuous support of ACSian Theatre and the work done to continue
crafting well-told stories for the stage.</p>
