<p>The play follows Scheherazade, a brilliant girl who has been commanded
to become the next bride of the murderous king, Shahryar. King Shahryar
executed each bride on their wedding night, to take revenge on his unfaithful
first wife. However, Scheherazade told stories night after night, entertaining
the king and preventing her death. After one thousand and one nights of
fantastical tales, King Shahryar had fallen in love with Scheherazade and
her stories ended the cycle of suffering and unhappiness.</p>
<p>Being a part of 1001 Nights was a rewarding process as the cast were introduced
to new skills, such as combat with weapons and Middle Eastern dances. The
J1s performed this hilarious, heartfelt play with thorough commitment and
dedication to storytelling. The audience left our ACJC Faith Centre for
Performing Arts thoroughly entertained, marking the JC1s first show a success!</p>
<p>For their constant care during this journey, we would like to thank our
teachers: Mrs Geetha Creffield, Ms Michelle Wong, Ms Annabel Tan, Mr Tobias
Teo and Mdm Baljeet Kaur. Thanks must also be issued to Randell Siow and
Gerard S Raj, who choreographed the combat and dance respectively. Also,
we are grateful for our amazing seniors and alumni for their support in
performance and by crewing backstage for us. Namely, to Faye Foong, thank
you for your guidance and to Danil Syrov, our director, thank you for bringing
the magic to 1001 Nights.</p>
<p>Finally, our audience, school leaders, teachers and many friends, we appreciate
your enthusiastic and continued support for the cast. We return the applause
to you!</p>
<p>To God be the Glory, The Best is Yet to Be!</p>
