<p>On the 24th of February, the ACJC Debate and Oratorical Society gathered
at the Central Public Library for the NLB’s <em>Read To Be Sure</em> exhibition
debate. As part of the national Ready To Be Sure initiative, ACJC has been
collaborating with NLB in an ongoing series of open debates. These debates
aim to increase awareness of current affairs and encourage the public to
form their own opinions through interactive floor debate segments.</p>
<p>On the motion of “This House Regrets COP28’s Climate Change Progress,”
three of our debaters engaged in a spirited clash against the National
Development Team, fearlessly tackling the intricate nuances surrounding
the progress of the 28th annual United Nations climate meeting, particularly
in transitioning away from fossil fuels.</p>
<p>A collaboration between Anglo-Chinese Junior College and the National
Library Board, this series of exhibition debates continues to serve as
a platform for conducive discourse on contemporary issues, from artificial
intelligence to sustainability. This event was a truly stimulating intellectual
exercise that inspired all of us to reflect on our collective responsibility
towards climate change.</p>
<p>The NLB exhibition debates continued with a critical issue in an increasingly
silver nation. 'Should Singapore abolish the retirement age?' This was
the question intensely debated on the 27th of April 2024 at Woodlands Regional
Library, where our ACJC debaters went against Tampines-Meridian JC.</p>
<p>Woodlands Regional Library was specifically chosen for this occasion as
it is one of the libraries most actively advocating for a better understanding
of Singapore’s ageing population. We were glad to see our debaters eagerly
taking notes and participating in the floor discussions, with one member
even presenting a rap to sum up the debate. We would like to thank Ms Annabelle
Tan for adjudicating the round, as well as our teachers and coach for the
support.
