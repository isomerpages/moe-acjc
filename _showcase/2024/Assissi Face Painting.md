<p>On June 9, ACSian Theatre brought colour and joy to Assisi Fun Day with
a vibrant face-painting booth! This heartwarming event at St. Joseph's
Institution International (SJII) brings together community partners to
raise funds for Assisi Hospice to provide palliative care to patients with
life-limiting illnesses.</p>

<p>ACSian Theatreâ€™s face-painting booth was a success, with CCA members united
in the collective effort to transform children and adults into their favourite
characters with a wide variety of hand-painted designs. Using our theatre-based
makeup skills, we spread cheer and creativity and were heartened to see
the excitement and enthusiasm of the visitors to our booth.</p>
<p>This event was a wonderful blend of fun and community spirit, reflecting
what we believe in as a CCA. We learned that dedication to this project
goes beyond mere face-painting; this was about connecting with the community,
encouraging others and celebrating individuality. This holistic experience
was one we will never forget, creating lasting memories through this meaningful
VIA (Values-in-Action) project. We built a sense of bonding and camaraderie,
and the celebratory smiles and laughter from the customers were surely
a reward like no other.</p>
