<p>The 10th Asean Student Science Project Competition aims to promote scientific
learning processes and the development of 21st-century skills among young
people. A total of 150 participants from 10 ASEAN countries took part in
this event.</p>
<p>We are pleased to announce that our SSEF Gold award winner, Chloe Gan
Mingle attained 4th place in the Biological Science category.</p>

<p>Here are some of her thoughts:</p>
<p>“My project focused on analysing differentially expressed genes throughout
the ripening process of the Sapodilla fruit, an underrepresented regional
plant. This research is crucial as it can offer insights into enhancing
fruit quality and shelf life through genetic engineering. My project was
judged by scientists from all over Asia, and I achieved fourth place in
the Biological Science category.</p>
<p>The competition was an enlightening experience where I interacted with
like-minded students from various countries, exchanging knowledge and ideas.
My biggest takeaway from ASPC was the importance of being open-minded and
proactive in learning. Different countries have unique resources and research
interests, leading to a variety of intriguing projects and perspectives.</p>
<p>Moreover, I had the chance to engage in a cultural exchange by visiting
Museum Siam, where I learned about Thailand's rich history and vibrant
culture. The museum offered an interactive and immersive experience, helping
me understand Thailand’s culture well.</p>
<p>Overall, ASPC was both fun and enriching. I am deeply grateful to the
college for supporting me to participate in ASPC and for the invaluable
experiences it has provided. Thank you.”</p>
