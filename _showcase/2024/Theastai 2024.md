<p>This showcase featured eighteen distinct and sincere monologues brought
from the page to the stage by the class. Over the course of Theasthai,
the audience was introduced to characters as various as teenagers dealing
with family issues, an actor bored with his role in a play, and a fairytale
princess who is fed up with how unfairly she has been treated.</p>
<p>In order to bring these characters to life, the class worked hard to analyse
the stories and embody the truth of their characters through the Stanislavski
System. This process required these student actors to delve deep into the
motivations of their characters. Throughout the rehearsal process, techniques
to strengthen and refine choices in performance were reflected upon and
used to develop the work further.</p>
<p>The class would like to thank our teachers – Mrs Geetha Creffield, Ms
Michelle Wong and Ms Annabel Tan – and our seniors and alumni for their
constant support and guidance throughout the Theasthai process. We would
also like to thank our school leaders, teachers, parents and schoolmates
for supporting the showcase as audience members and encouraging us throughout
this process.</p>
<p>To God Be The Glory,</p>
