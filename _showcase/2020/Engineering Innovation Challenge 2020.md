## <center> Engineering Innovation Challenge 2020 </center>

The Engineering Innovation Challenge 2020 is jointly organised by the Institution of Engineers, Singapore (IES) and Science Centre Singapore with the support of the Ministry of Education and sponsored by the National Research Foundation (NRF).Â 

3 teams of 4 students represented ACJC in this competition, developing their project ideas involving radiation in food preparation or preservation under the guidance of 3 mentors with professional expertise in the industry: Mr Vincent Chan, Mr Mitesh Kumar and Ms Kris Tan. All 3 teams were shortlisted for the final round, to create a prototype, and a video explaining their prototype.

The Challenge was a wonderful opportunity for our students to learn outside of the classroom and apply their understanding in a real-world context. We congratulate our participants for their excellent work! Our participants and winners are:
