## <center> Culminatio 2020 </center>

Showcasing the DEP Class of 2020's collaborative performances,&nbsp;_Culminatio_&nbsp;concludes the end of the class’ two years of rigorous and innovative performance practice. During the circuit-breaker period and home-based learning weeks, students met on Zoom to rehearse their lines. To the amusement and annoyance of housemates and roommates, vocal and physical warm-ups became a regular part of the “stay home, stay safe” routine.

The socially-distanced evening began with a dystopian future world of&nbsp;Model Students&nbsp;rebelling against authority. Written by Kendra Thomas, this play uses the context of Artificial Intelligence to question stereotypical and socially constructed traits that are taught and caught by youths. Then we travelled down the rabbit hole into a dramatic adaptation of Lewis Carroll's&nbsp;Alice in Wonderland. With the innovative use of dance, music and props, this group brought to life fantastical places and creatures. Finally, we were brought back to reality with a play about the bizarre world of modern dating. David Ives’&nbsp;Sure Thing&nbsp;explores the expectations, pretenses and deal-breakers that drive these somewhat ill-advised attempts to pick up a stranger.

Celebrating this class' tremendous efforts made to devise and rehearse during a pandemic, this year's Culminatio was performed with gusto and recorded for the entertainment of friends and family. The Class of 2020 is to be congratulated for their innovation and perseverance in this nontraditional rendition of our traditional showcase.
