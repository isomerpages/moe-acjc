This year, the ACJC Debate club hosted the annual Orator’s Trophy, aimed at providing a platform for budding orators to hone their oratorical and speech abilities. A revamped online competition format was adopted to overcome the challenges and restrictions as a result of COVID-19. We would like to take this opportunity to applaud the tenacity of all 97 participants who bravely took on the new competition format.

  
We would also like to send our heartiest congratulations to the winners of the competition. In the Junior Category, Quistyna Raphaelle Abdullah Sullivan from Zhenghua Secondary School took the champion's position. In the senior category, Kirthana Ramanan from Raffles Girls’ School ranked top.

We would also like to congratulate our ACJC Debate and Oratorical Society member, Deeksha Kapoor for making it into the semi-finals of the Pre-U league. Both ACSians are pictured at left.

  

We would like to express our gratitude to the independent pool of judges who helped to make this competition possible by giving their time to help develop public speaking as an important life-skill. We would like to thank the school leaders and teachers for supporting us in this endeavour and giving us the opportunity to organise something for the benefit of other schools.

To God be the glory! The Best is yet to Be!
