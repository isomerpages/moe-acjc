From the 24th to the 29th of November, the AH class of 2020 and the recipients of the MOE Humanities Scholarship participated in a learning journey to Chengdu, China. As an economy close to Singapore as well as a geopolitical powerhouse of Asia, China presented many fascinating learning opportunities for the class. The participants of the trip were accompanied by Mr Mori Toshiyuki, Ms Michelle Wong and Mrs Geetha Creffield, who played crucial roles in organising and chaperoning throughout the trip.

During the trip, the students took part in a classroom exchange with Chengdu No. 7 Experimental High School, allowing them to learn about the educational system in Chengdu. Furthermore, they also learned about global efforts to conserve endangered species through their visit to the Chengdu Panda Research Centre, as well as about the start-up scene in China through their visit to High-Tech Industrial Development Zone. They also became more aware about the cultural heritage of Chengdu, through their visits to the Intangible Cultural Heritage Park and the Shun Xing Teahouse Museum where the class saw various fascinating cultural performances. All in all, the trip was invaluable in expanding the knowledge and understanding of all students involved.

  

The participants of the Humanities Trip would like to express their sincere gratitude to the teachers for their tireless work and guidance, to the school for providing them with this invaluable learning opportunity, and to all their hosts for their generous hospitality.
