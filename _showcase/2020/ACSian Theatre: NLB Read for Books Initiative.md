On 23 July 2020, ACSian Theatre members joined forces over Zoom to record a dramatic reading of Fantastic Mr Fox by Roald Dahl. We worked in collaboration with the National Library Board’s initiative “Read for Books”, a charity book drive which aims to raise awareness of reading and to share the gift of reading with the library’s selected beneficiaries.

Although we could not come together to rehearse in person, we made the most of the situation. Making animal headpieces for a more immersive experience, we met on Zoom to rehearse and perform a dramatic reading of Mr Fox’s fantastic plans.

It is heartwarming to know that we are able to share the joy of reading with others via a digital recording.

We would like to thank our beloved backstage crew and costumers for working with us during the crafting and rehearsal process. We would also like to express our gratitude to Mrs Geetha Creffield, Ms Michelle Wong, Mr Tobias Teo, Mdm Baljeet Kaur, Ms Low Tze Hui and Ms Annabel Tan for organising and helping us prepare for this VIA experience.

  

To God be the Glory, The Best is Yet to Be!
