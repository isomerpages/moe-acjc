On the 21st of February 2020, Anglo-Chinese Junior College (ACJC) received the GCE A-level results for the Class of 2019. Due to the ongoing COVID-19 situation, we took steps to decentralise the results collection process, having our alumni collect their results on a form class level. We trust that this was a meaningful experience for them

The College is proud to announce that the Class of 2019 have achieved excellent results, a true testament to their hard work, dedication, and determination. Of the subjects offered at the H2 level, all achieved percentage passes above the national average. More than half of the subjects offered at H1 level including Project Work, had percentage passes above national average, with many gaining distinctions for more than half their cohorts.

  

During their 2 years at ACJC, the members of the Class of 2019 have distinguished themselves on the playing field, in performances, in clubs and societies, in academics, and in their service to others. The College gives thanks for each and every one of them. We will be sharing some of their stories in an upcoming article.

  

The College would like to thank all who have played a part in the success of the Class of 2019: our dedicated staff, the ever-supportive parents of the Class of 2019, and the wider ACS and Methodist family.

  

Most of all, we give thanks to God for His infinite goodness.

  

_To God be the Glory! The Best is Yet to Be!_
