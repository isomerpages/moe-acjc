## <center> Santa Claus: Origins </center>

Towards the end of 2019, ACSian Theatre produced Santa Claus: Origins, a theatrical adaptation of the book “The Life and Adventures of Santa Claus” written by L. Frank Baum. The play explored the life of Claus as he ventured through the world and encountered new people in his journey to become the iconic symbol of Christmas that many of us know and love today. It is a story set in a land of immortal beings and friendly faces, where unconditional love and support are given without hesitation. ACSian Theatre brought this humorous play to life, filling every scene with joy and, undoubtedly, endearing itself to the audience.

The performers displayed their exuberant energy, evoking hearty laughs from the audience throughout the performance. The ensemble’s playful and cheery spirit spread joy and laughter to the audience.

  

The creative props and costumes were magnificently designed to reflect Christmas as the most wonderful time of the year and to fully immerse the audience in the sparkling world of Santa Claus. The four expertly choreographed dance numbers, inclusive of numerous iconic Christmas songs as well as modern pop music, showcased ACSian Theatre’s versatility and created a festive ambience.

  

We would also like to extend our deepest gratitude to Mrs Geetha Creffield, Ms Michelle Wong, Mr Tobias Teo, Mdm Baljeet Kaur, Ms Low Tze Hui, Mr Gerard Sebastian Raj, Mr Adrian Poon and Ms Mary Ann Tear for making this production a magical and beautiful one. We would also like to thank our School Leaders, teachers, parents and alumni for all their support and we send them our well wishes.
