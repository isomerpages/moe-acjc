Honours Day is an annual event celebrating the achievements of the graduating class. In 2021, it was held on 8 October 2021 immediately following the Baccalaureate Service that marked the end of formal classes for the graduating batch. Due to the ongoing need for social distancing, the programme was decentralised among the form classes rather than being held in the Hall as was traditional. The students had a meaningful time of fellowship with their classmates, and viewed a video highlighting special awards. Despite the trying times the Class of 2021 have been through, Honours Day truly celebrated their achievements in the face of adversity!
