#### AC Celebrations 2021  

On 11 February 2021 Thursday, ACJC held its first ever virtual AC Celebrations! In the spirit to commemorate the Lunar New Year amid the COVID-19 pandemic, the celebrations took on a very unique yet meaningful form this year! 

In the morning of Lunar New Year eve, our JC1 OG Reps and JC2 Class Reps presented the mandarin oranges to their teachers, blessing them a very prosperous new year. In return, our teachers handed the students with the ACJC commemorative red packet with words of encouragement! Lishen and Nicole, our Student Councillors President and Vice-President, represented the student body to present our School Leaders with mandarin oranges and in return, they received the ACJC commemorative red packets as well!

Our talented Performing Arts groups unleashed their creativity and passion while adhering to Safe Management Measures (SMMs) by recording their outstanding performances on video! We were treated to an exhilarating line-up of performances from ACSian Theatre, Choir, AC Dance, Band, Strings Ensemble, Guitar Ensemble, Malay Cultural Society and Chinese Cultural Society! Below is a Sneak peek from ACSian Theatre “Chalo! Chalo!”

##### And do not forget to do good and share with others—Hebrews 13:16

In the spirit of festive giving, our JC1 students designed Chinese New Year cards for the underprivileged elderly living in the Dover and French Road community. These handmade-with-love cards and the Total Defence Day Care Packages will be sent to the beneficiaries within this month. Our JC2 students designed Chinese New Year cards for their loved ones, to express their deep appreciation and gratitude to them.

To celebrate the 135th anniversary of the founding of ACS this year, the College gave these limited edition commemorative red packets. We give all the glory to God for inspiring our College with such a divine design. This collectible item features our iconic Creature crest and the ACS 135 logo.

We had an abundance of fun activities in our cosy classrooms in the morning. We thoroughly and truly enjoyed one another’s company, remembering the goodness of God. 

Indeed, in this brand new year, God will supply all our needs according to His riches in glory in Christ Jesus—Philippians 4:19. To God Be The Glory, The Best Is Yet To Be!
