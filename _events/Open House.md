**Open House 2022: Be an ACSian, Be AC!**

ACJC's e-Open House successfully concluded on 13 Jan 2022. This year, we chose the theme "Be&nbsp; AC", and were happy to welcome all those who were keen to grow in their passion to explore the endless possibilities of who they could be.&nbsp;

  

We are grateful for your enthusiastic participation.&nbsp;
