**Open House 2022: Be an ACSian, Be AC!**

ACJC's e-Open House successfully concluded on 13 Jan 2022. This year, we chose the theme "Be  AC", and were happy to welcome all those who were keen to grow in their passion to explore the endless possibilities of who they could be. 

  

We are grateful for your enthusiastic participation.
