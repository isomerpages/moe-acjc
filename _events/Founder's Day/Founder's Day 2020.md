## <center> Founder's Day 2020 </center>

The ACS Family of Schools celebrate Founder's Day each year on 1 March. On Founder's Day we celebrate the achievements of the College with a particular focus on cherishing the academic and co-curricular achievements of the graduating class, as well as the graduating class of two years prior.

  

Due to the ongoing COVID-19 situation, in alignment with the ACS Board of Governors we were forced to take the difficult decision to cancel the 2020 Founderâ€™s Day Thanksgiving Service. The well-being of staff, students and all other stakeholders and participants was, of course, our paramount concern and the social distancing measures and practices regarding mass events made it unfeasible for us to carry on with the service as planned.

  

Nonetheless ACJC celebrated the occasion in spirit in the sure and certain knowledge that The Best is Yet to Be!
