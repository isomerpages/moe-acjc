The Methodist Walk is a biennial fundraising event to raise funds which will go towards maintaining our College's facilities and funding programmes for our students. In addition, the College is also committed to achieving a total of at least 13,500 km in commemoration of ACS135. We hope families, friends and ACSians of past and present will support us in this endeavour. Your contributions will play an important role in ensuring a holistic education for our students.
