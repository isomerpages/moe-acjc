This year’s Founder’s Day will be an especially significant one as we celebrate the 135th anniversary of the founding of ACS. Our students have many meaningful activities lined up for them. They will be taking part in initiatives organised by the ACSOBA, such as the ACS135 Photography Competition. Leading up to 1 March, ACJC will be marking Heritage Week in which our students will learn about ACS pioneers and reflect on their own role as ACSians who will create a legacy for those who come after them. The celebrations will culminate in a virtual combined service on 1 March that unites ACSians in spirit even though we cannot be together in person. 

The ACSOBA has many exciting programmes lined up. Please visit the [ACS135 website](https://www.acs135.com/) to find out more.

To God be the Glory! The Best is Yet to Be!
