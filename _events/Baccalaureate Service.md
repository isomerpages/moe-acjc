## <center> Baccalaureate Service </center>

The annual Baccalaureate Service is an occasion all ACSians cherish- it is a day of thanksgiving, marking the end of formal classes for the graduating batch as they prepare for the last lap toward the 'A'-levels. In 2021, due to the need for social distancing, the programme carried on in a modified format on 8 October 2021. Baccalaureate 2020 brought the College together via a live Zoom session augmented by pre-recorded performances and commemorative videos put together to send the Class of 2021 off on the last leg of their journey with the College. It was followed by the Honours Day service which celebrated the achievements of the Class of 2021.
