The ACS Old Boys’ Association (ACSOBA) was formed in 1914, and since its inception has been an integral part of the ACS family. Not only has it provided a means for students to maintain their ties with each other and their alma mater, it works with the Board of Governors and the ACS schools to provide support and programmes that maintain the ACSian tradition of excellence. The ACSOBA embodies the commitment to ‘stand together for the cause of ACS forever’ in the words of the ACS anthem, to nurture future generations of men and women who will make a positive difference to Singapore and the world.
