The House System was introduced in 1929 by then principal T W Hinch, following the English tradition to promote a spirit of healthy rivalry and to give the boys a greater opportunity to participate in school life. The original houses were named after Bishop James Thoburn, Bishop William Oldham, Revered Goh Hood Keng, Mr Tan Kah Kee and Mr Cheong Koon Seng. In 2004, three new houses were added, named for Dr Lee Seng Gee, Dr Shaw Vee Meng and Tan Sri (Dr) Tan Chin Tuan.
