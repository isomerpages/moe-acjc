<p>The ACJC Grace Heritage Gallery was opened in 2015, and tells the story of ACJC, tracing our roots from Bishop William F. Oldham’s visionary zeal to establish a mission, to our development over the decades to be a College recognised for excellence and our exceptional all-round education. Playing the role of a ‘memorial stone’, the ACJC Grace Heritage Gallery is thus named to remind generations of ACSians that the success of ACJC is built on the grace of God.</p>
