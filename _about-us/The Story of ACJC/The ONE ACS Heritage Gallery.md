The ONE ACS Heritage Gallery, a gift from the ACSOBA to the ACS family of schools, presents highlights of the history of the ACS family in a contemporary manner and showcases original artefacts from Bishop Oldham’s personal collection and memorabilia from all the ACS units. The Gallery also provides tablets that contain special features, videos, interviews and archived photographs, as well as The ACS Story compiled by the late Mr Earnest Lau, in a digital format. The artefacts will be rotated periodically to vary the visitor experience.
