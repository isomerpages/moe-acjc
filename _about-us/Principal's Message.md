As we step into 2026, I am deeply honoured to serve Anglo-Chinese Junior College (ACJC) as its 7th Principal. Having walked these very corridors as a student, ACJC holds a special place in my heart.&nbsp; It is truly a joy and a blessing to be able to return to lead this vibrant community as we continue to build upon the rich traditions and values that define the ACSian identity.

This is a significant year for our family, as we celebrate the 140th anniversary of the founding of the Anglo-Chinese School (ACS). We thank God for His love, faithfulness and grace through these many years. Reflecting on our heritage, we recall the vision of our founder, Bishop William Fitzjames Oldham, who sought to nurture young people of character. He believed that education was not merely the acquisition of knowledge, but the shaping of a soul to be of service to God and others. Today, ACJC remains a steadfast steward of this legacy, committed to an all-round education of the highest standards based on Christian principles.

In a rapidly evolving world, we are focused on helping our students become lifelong learners who genuinely enjoy the process of learning. We foster curiosity, cultivate creativity and develop tenacity that will serve them well beyond their time with us

However, learning at ACJC is never an end in itself. We empower our students to direct their education and passions meaningfully into making a real difference in the lives of others — whether through the arts, sciences, sports, leadership or community service, and in their daily lives. We believe each of them has the potential to bring hope and positive change to the people and world around them.

This belief is reflected in our theme for 2026, shared across all ACS schools: 'A Beacon of Truth and Light' guided by the theme verse found in Matthew 5:16: "In the same way, let your light shine before others, that they may see your good deeds and glorify your Father in heaven."

At ACJC, we believe every student possesses unique strengths and talents and a desire to use them to make a difference. Our mission is to ensure that they discover and channel these purposefully with a spirit of excellence, a commitment to integrity, and a heart for service.&nbsp;

What makes ACJC truly special is our caring and collaborative community. Our students create our vibrant culture, supported by our dedicated staff, wonderful Parents' Action Team (PAT), and deeply loyal alumni network. Together, we build an enabling environment that nurtures noble ambition anchored on sound character and values.

As we celebrate this milestone year, we do so with deep appreciation for our past, grateful hearts for the present, and hopeful anticipation for the future. I look forward to working alongside all of you to grow and develop every ACSian to be a beacon of God’s light, carrying forward the values and passion that define us.

To God be the Glory! The Best is Yet to Be!
