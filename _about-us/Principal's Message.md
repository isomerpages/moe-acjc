**A College of Choice and Distinction**

Education in the 21st century demands depth of knowledge and breadth of skills.  Anglo-Chinese Junior College (ACJC) is a college of choice and distinction that allows students to pursue their interests while experiencing an all-rounded education that prepares them well to take their place of pride in society.

ACJC is one of the seven educational institutions of the ACS Family of Schools. The Anglo-Chinese School was founded by Methodist missionary, William Fitzjames Oldham as he recognised the importance of education in uplifting lives and shaping society.  Since our founding in 1886, we have provided all students with a holistic education of the highest standards based on Christian principles.

ACJC continues to grow from strength to strength, nurturing our students to possess Noble Ambition and Character, for the Service of God and nation. In a landscape of changing social norms, our students are taught to uphold strong moral values and principles. The values of Integrity, Tenacity and Passion undergird all aspects of College life, be it in academic pursuits or in the many co-curricular activities. In an increasingly polarised world, our students are encouraged to love and serve others, ultimately making a difference in the community.

We are proud that many of our students and alumni have made their mark in society, impacting Singapore and the region through their contributions in the fields of Science, the Arts and Culture, Technology, Business, Politics, Sports and others. They uphold the legacy of service established by our founders.

ACJC moves into the 21st century with the commitment to nurture values-driven leaders and future-ready thinkers within a caring and collaborative community. Even as we strive towards our goal of enabling students to reach their full potential, all students can be assured of support at every stage in their growth at ACJC. They do not journey alone. Together with stakeholders who are actively involved in our mission, they are supported and cheered on by a committed faculty, supportive parents and caring alumni.

Generations of ACSians have passed our gates and discovered their purpose and place in society. Many others will continue to receive the blessings of an education at ACJC. We pledge to do our utmost for the service of God and nation. To God be the Glory. The Best is Yet to Be.
