Dear Parents,

Greetings from the Parents’ Action Team (PAT).

A warm welcome to all our new J1 students and our returning J2 students. This year,
ACS celebrates its 140 th anniversary and as part of the larger ACS family, ACJC has an exciting year planned for our school community.

At ACJC, we are blessed to have a strong community of parents who are united by a
common goal to contribute positively to the growth, wellbeing and success of our
school and students. We welcome you to be part of the ACJC’s Parents Action Team
(PAT), a community of caring parents of past and present students.

As our children embark into their tertiary life in a year or two, these two years at ACJC is an important time of growth, change and self-discovery. During this time, a strong partnership between parents, students and the school are especially important. This is where the PAT comes in to support our school through programmes designed to encourage, uplift and care for our students in practical and meaningful ways. Whether through providing food and refreshments for students during examination periods, coming together in prayer for the school community, or serving as family mentors to international students so that they feel welcomed and connected to school life in Singapore, our programmes are grounded in care and encouragement. Through these efforts, we seek to reassure our students that they are supported not only academically, but also emotionally and spiritually.

We warmly invite all parents to serve with us as volunteers. Your time, skills and
presence, no matter how big or small the commitment can make a meaningful
difference. Together, we can build a strong, inclusive and supportive environment that helps our children thrive during their time in ACJC, while also building lasting
friendships and wonderful memories as fellow parent volunteers.

We look forward to seeing you at one of our programmes this year.

With God’s blessings,

Parents Action Team Committee
