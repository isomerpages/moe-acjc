Dear Parents,

Welcome back to the 2022 school year!  

This year will be another exciting and blessed journey for all of us (in spite of the challenges of the ongoing pandemic) – for the new J1 parents, it is entering into the tertiary education arena with much anticipation; for the returning J2 parents, it is the final year where our child will sit for his/her major exam at the end of the year. Regardless of where you are in this journey, you are not alone.

We are blessed in ACJC to have a wonderfully supportive and strong community of parents. Parents who passionately care about supporting their child, and who would work closely with the College to provide a holistic nurturing environment for our sons and daughters. We welcome you to be part of the ACJC's Parents' Action Team (PAT). This is where you can actively be part of a community that encourages each other, share experiences, and tap on our expertise to nurture our charges and contribute meaningfully in our child’s journey in ACJC. Our participation goes beyond supporting our child. It goes to supporting his/her friends, schoolmates and to the larger group of students in the College. This being even more critical as our children go through potentially another year of pandemic enforced adaptations as part of their social and educational journey.&nbsp;

  

However it is through dedicated partnership with you that we can role model and create a place where our children can achieve their potential, remain assured of parental support and instil confidence to lead a fulfilling life. Join us on this meaningful journey, and we look forward to seeing you at one of our programmes this year!

With God’s blessings,  

Li-Anne Fones-Leong &amp; Mark Leong
