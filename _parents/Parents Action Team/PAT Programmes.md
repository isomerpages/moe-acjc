### Exam Food Ministry

As our students prepare for the year-end examinations, parents show their love and care for the students by providing nutritious meals to the students who stay back to study or seek consultations with their subject teachers. Past students have testified to the difference EFM has made to their learning journey and studying for the A level examination. This meaningful tradition of providing meals is only possible with the combined hard work and efforts of many parents. Your strong support will certainly count towards the success of EFM. 

### Foreign Scholars' Mentorship Programme

We have students from foreign countries studying at ACJC.  The Foreign Scholars’ Mentorship Programme matches these students to parent volunteers.  The parent mentors lend their support to the students as they study in ACJC, either by by acting as a de-facto parent, as a provider of encouragement or by sharing a meal at critical periods like holidays, Birthday, or during the examination period.  Often these students will feel a sense of belonging being cared for by their mentors.  The lives of the mentors and their families are enriched by the experience too.

### Teachers' Day Celebration

It is an important day in the college calendar when students and parents come together to show their thanks and appreciation to the college’s teachers and staff.  The PAT team works closely with the ACJC Student Council to organize a lunch to commemorate the celebration.

#### Prayer Ministry

The College's Vision - Noble Ambition and Character, for the Service of God and Nation also underlies what is the single ministry that extends through the calendar year. On average 30 to 40 Parents through the year come together to stand in the gap for our College- The Leaders/ Our Teachers/ Our children - Through Prayer. We have four distinct but intertwined offering via our Thursday Prayer Group, Fathers Prayer Group, Combined ACS Prayer Meeting and A Level Prayer Vigil.


### Fun-O-Rama 

An event hosted once every 2 years to allow our students to plan and develop themselves as future thinkers, nurture value driven leaders who also give back to community. Together with the student body, we building a caring and collaborative community that also raises funds for the college and exhibits the spirit of paying it forward.
